In some \\ncases, reducing non-CO2 emissions can have a more rapid effect on the climate and be more cost-effective \\nthan reducing CO2 emissions. Given the important role that mitigation of non-CO2 greenhouse gases can \\nplay in climate strategies, there is a clear need for an improved understanding of the mitigation potential \\nfor non-CO2 sources, as well as for the incorporation of non-CO2 greenhouse gas mitigation in climate \\neconomic analyses. This report is a follow-on to the 2006 EPA report Global Mitigation of Non-CO2 \\nGreenhouse Gases and illustrates the abatement potential of non-CO2 greenhouse gases through a \\ncomprehensive global analysis and resulting data set of marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves.  \\nThe report provides a comprehensive global analysis and resulting data set of MACs that illustrate \\nthe abatement potential of non-CO2 greenhouse gases by sector and by region. This analysis incorporates \\nupdated mitigation technologies, costs, and emissions baselines with an updated modeling approach. The \\nresults of the analysis are MAC curves that reflect aggregated break-even prices for implementing \\nmitigation options in a given sector and region with more detail than available in the previous report. \\nThis assessment of mitigation potential is unique because it is comprehensive across all non-CO2 \\ngreenhouse gases, across all emitting sectors of the economy, and across all regions of the world. The \\nMAC curves allow for improved understanding of the mitigation potential for non-CO2 sources, as well \\nas inclusion of non-CO2 greenhouse gas mitigation in economic modeling of multigas mitigation \\nstrategies.  \\nThe basic methodology\\u2014a bottom-up, engineering cost approach\\u2014is the same as the methodology \\nfollowed in the 2006 report. Building on the baseline non-CO2 emissions projections from the USEPA\\u2019s \\nGlobal Anthropogenic Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 1990\\u20132030 (2012), this analysis applies mitigation \\noptions to the emissions baseline in each sector. The technical abatement potential and cost are calculated \\nfor each mitigation option across all the emitting greenhouse gas sectors. The average break-even price is \\ncalculated for the estimated abatement potential for each mitigation option. The options are then ordered \\nin ascending order of break-even price (cost) and plotted against abatement potential. The resulting MAC \\nis a stepwise function; each point on the curve represents the break-even price point for a discrete \\nmitigation option (or defined bundle of mitigation strategies) and the associated abatement potential. \\nThis report makes no explicit assumption about policies that would be required to facilitate and generate \\nadoption of mitigation options. Therefore, this report provides estimates of technical mitigation potential.  \\nG\\nreen \\nhouse gases other than carbon dioxide (CO2) play an important role in the effort to \\nunderstand and address global climate change. Non-carbon dioxide (non-CO2) greenhouse \\ngases include methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and a number of high global warming \\npotential or fluorinated gases. The non-CO2 greenhouse gases are more potent than CO2 (per \\nunit weight) at trapping heat within the atmosphere and, once emitted, can remain in the atmosphere for \\neither shorter or longer periods of time than CO2. Approximately 30% of the anthropogenic greenhouse \\neffect since preindustrial times can be attributed to these non-CO2 greenhouse gases (Intergovernmental \\nPanel for Climate Change [IPCC], 2001b); approximately 25% of GWP-weighted greenhouse gas \\nemissions in the year 2005 comprise the non-CO2 greenhouse gases (U.S. Environmental Protection \\nAgency [USEPA], 2012). \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nES-2 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nThe results of this analysis are MAC curves that reflect the prices for implementing mitigation \\noptions in a given sector and region. This report provides improved data to better understand the \\nmitigation potential for non-CO2 sources and allows for inclusion of non-CO2 greenhouse gas mitigation \\napproaches in economic modeling of multigas mitigation strategies. The MAC data sets can be \\ndownloaded \\nin \\nspreadsheet \\nformat \\nfrom \\nthe \\nUSEPA \\nWeb \\nsite \\nat \\nhttp://www.epa.gov/climatechange/EPAactivities/economics/nonco2mitigation.html. \\nMitigation of Non-CO2 Gases Can Play an Important Role in Climate Strategies. Worldwide, the \\npotential for cost-effective non-CO2 greenhouse gas abatement is significant. Figure ES-1 shows the global \\ntotal aggregate MAC for the year 2030. Without a price signal (i.e., at $0/tCO2e), the global mitigation \\npotential is greater than 1,800 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e), or 12% of the baseline \\nemissions (refer to Section I.3.3 of this report for a more detailed explanation of unrealized mitigation \\npotential in the MACs). As the break-even price rises, the mitigation potential grows. Significant \\nmitigation opportunities could be realized in the lower range of break-even prices. The global mitigation \\npotential at a price of $10/tCO2e is greater than 3,000 MtCO2e, or 20% of the baseline emissions, and \\ngreater than 2,400 MtCO2e or 24% of the baseline emissions at $20/tCO2e. In the higher range of break-\\neven prices, the MAC becomes steeper, and less mitigation potential exists for each additional increase in \\nprice. \\nFigure ES-1: Global Total Aggregate MAC for Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases in 2030 \\n \\n \\n-$40\\n-$20\\n$0\\n$20\\n$40\\n$60\\n$80\\n$100\\n0\\n500\\n1,000\\n1,500\\n2,000\\n2,500\\n3,000\\n3,500\\n4,000\\n4,500\\n$/tCO2e \\nNon-CO2 Reductions (MtCO2e) \\nGlobally, the Sectors with the Greatest Potential for Mitigation of Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases are \\nthe Energy and Agriculture Sectors.

At a \\nbreak-even price of $5/tCO2e, the potential to reduce of non-CO2 greenhouse gases is greater than 1,190 \\nMtCO2e in the energy sector and approximately 1,080 MtCO2e in the industrial process sector.  At a \\nbreak-even price of $30/tCO2e, the potential increases to approximately 1,475 MtCO2e in the industrial \\nsector, nearly 1,400 MtCO2e in the energy sector, and 500 and 332 MtCO2e in the agriculture and waste \\nsectors, respectively.  \\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nES-3 \\nMethane Mitigation has the Largest Potential across All the Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases. \\nFigure ES-3 shows the global MACs by greenhouse gas type for 2030.

Technical Summary \\nI.1 \\nOverview \\nThis report is an update to the 2006 EPA report, Global Mitigation of Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases, and \\nincorporates an updated modeling approach and new data on mitigation technologies, costs, and \\nemissions baselines. The basic methodology\\u2014a bottom-up, engineering cost approach\\u2014is the same as \\nwas followed in the 2006 report, with some enhancements (as described in Section I.3.4 of this report). \\nThe results of this analysis are marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves. The end result of this report is a \\nset of marginal abatement curves (MACs) that allow for improved understanding of the mitigation \\npotential for non-CO2 sources, as well as inclusion of non-CO2 greenhouse gas mitigation in economic \\nmodeling.

The non-CO2 gases include methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and a number of \\nhigh global warming potential or fluorinated gases. The non-CO2 greenhouse gases are more potent than \\nCO2 (per unit weight) at trapping heat within the atmosphere and, once emitted, can remain in the \\natmosphere for either shorter or longer periods of time than CO2. Figure I-1 shows that these non-CO2 \\ngreenhouse gases are responsible for approximately 30 percent of the enhanced, anthropogenic \\ngreenhouse effect since preindustrial times.  \\nTable I-1 shows the global total greenhouse gas emissions for the year 2010, broken down by sector \\nand by greenhouse gas type. The non-CO2 gases constitute 28 percent of the global total greenhouse gas \\nemissions. \\nT\\nhe \\n objective of this peer reviewed technical report is to provide a comprehensive and \\nconsistent data set on global mitigation of noncarbon dioxide (non-CO2) greenhouse gases by \\nsector and by region. Mitigating emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases can be relatively \\ninexpensive compared with mitigating CO2 emissions. Thus, attention continues to focus on \\nincorporating international non-CO2 greenhouse gas mitigation options into climate economic analyses. \\nThis requires a large data collection effort and expert analysis of available technologies and opportunities \\nfor greenhouse gas reductions across diverse regions and sectors.  \\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \\nI-2 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES Figure 1-1.

Available at: http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/EPAactivities/economics/nonco2projections.html  \\nI.2.1 \\nMethane (CH4) \\nCH4 is about 21 times more powerful at warming the atmosphere than CO2 over a 100-year period \\n(IPCC, 1996). In addition, CH4\\u2019s chemical lifetime in the atmosphere is approximately 12 years, compared \\nwith approximately 100 years for CO2. These two factors make CH4 a candidate for mitigating global \\nwarming in the near term (i.e., within the next 25 years or so) or in the time frame during which \\natmospheric concentrations of CH4 could respond to mitigation actions.  \\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nI-3 \\nCH4 is emitted from a variety of manmade sources, including landfills, oil and natural gas systems, \\nagricultural activities, coal mining, stationary and mobile combustion, wastewater treatment, and certain \\nindustrial processes. CH4 is also a primary constituent of natural gas and an important energy source. As \\na result, efforts to prevent or capture and use CH4 emissions can provide significant energy, economic, \\nand environmental benefits.  \\nI.2.2 \\nNitrous Oxide (N2O) \\nN2O is a clear, colorless gas with a slightly sweet odor. Because of its long atmospheric lifetime \\n(approximately 120 years) and heat-trapping effects\\u2014about 310 times more powerful than CO2 on a per-\\nmolecule basis\\u2014N2O is an important greenhouse gas. \\nN2O has both natural and manmade sources and is removed from the atmosphere mainly by \\nphotolysis (i.e., breakdown by sunlight) in the stratosphere. In the United States, the main manmade \\nsources of N2O are agricultural soil management, livestock waste management, mobile and stationary \\nfossil fuel combustion, adipic acid production, and nitric acid production. N2O is also produced naturally \\nfrom a variety of biological sources in soil and water.  \\nI.2.3 \\nF-Gases Gases \\nThere are three major groups or types of F-Gases gases: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), \\nperfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). These compounds are the most potent \\ngreenhouse gases because of their large heat-trapping capacity and, in the cases of SF6 and the PFCs, their \\nextremely long atmospheric lifetimes. Because some of these gases, once emitted, can remain in the \\natmosphere for centuries, their accumulation is essentially irreversible. F-Gases gases are emitted from a \\nbroad range of industrial sources; most of these gases have few (if any) natural sources. \\nHFCs \\nHFCs are manmade chemicals, many of which have been developed as alternatives to ozone-\\ndepleting substances (ODSs) for industrial, commercial, and consumer products. The GWPs of HFCs \\nrange from 140 (HFC-152a) to 11,700 (HFC-23). The atmospheric lifetime for HFCs varies from just over a \\nyear (HFC-152a) to 260 years (HFC-23). Most of the commercially used HFCs have atmospheric lifetimes \\nof less than 15 years (for example, HFC-134a, which is used in automobile air-conditioning and \\nrefrigeration, has an atmospheric lifetime of 14 years). \\nPFCs \\nPrimary aluminum production, semiconductor manufacturing and flat panel display manufacturing \\nare the largest known manmade sources of tetrafluoromethane (CF4), and hexafluoroethane (C2F6). PFCs \\nare also relatively minor substitutes for ODSs. Over a 100-year period, CF4 and C2F6 are, respectively, \\n6,500 and 9,200 times more effective than CO2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere.  \\nSulfur Hexaflouride (SF6) \\nThe GWP of SF6 is 23,900, making it the most potent greenhouse gas evaluated by IPCC. SF6 is a \\ncolorless, odorless, nontoxic, nonflammable gas with excellent dielectric properties. It is used (1) for \\ninsulation and current interruption in electric power transmission and distribution equipment; (2) to \\nprotect molten magnesium from oxidation and potentially violent burning in the magnesium industry; \\n(3) to create circuitry patterns and to clean vapor deposition chambers during manufacture of \\nsemiconductors and flat panel displays; and (4) for a variety of smaller uses, including uses as a tracer gas \\nand as a filler for sound-insulated windows. \\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \\nI-4 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nLike the PFCs, SF6 is very long lived, so all manmade sources contribute directly to its accumulation \\nin the atmosphere. Measurements of SF6 show that its global average concentration increased by about 7 \\npercent per year during the 1980s and 1990s, from less than 1 ppt in 1980 to almost 4 ppt in the late 1990s \\n(IPCC, 2001a). \\nI.2.4 \\nUse of GWPs in this Report \\nThe GWP compares the relative ability of each greenhouse gas to trap heat in the atmosphere during \\na certain time frame. Per IPCC (1996) guidelines, CO2 is the reference gas and thus has a GWP of 1. Based \\non a time frame of 100 years, the GWP of CH4 is 21 and the GWP of N2O is 310. Table I-2 lists all GWPs \\nused in this report to convert the non-CO2 emissions into CO2-equivalent units. This report uses GWPs \\nfrom the 1996 IPCC Second Assessment Report (rather than the 2001 Third Assessment Report) because \\nthese are the values specified by greenhouse gas reporting guidelines under the United Nations \\nFramework Convention on Climate Change.  \\nTable I-2: \\nGlobal Warming Potentials \\nGas \\nGWPa\\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) \\n1 \\nMethane (CH4) \\n21 \\nNitrous oxide (N2O) \\n310 \\nHFC-23 \\n11,700 \\nHFC-32 \\n650 \\nHFC-125 \\n2,800 \\nHFC-134a \\n1,300 \\nHFC-143a \\n3,800 \\nHFC-152a \\n140 \\nHFC-227ea \\n2,900 \\nHFC-236fa \\n6,300 \\nHFC-4310mee \\n1,300 \\nCF4 \\n6,500 \\nC2F6 \\n9,200 \\nC4F10 \\n7,000 \\nC6F14 \\n7,400 \\nSF6 \\n23,900 \\nSource: IPCC, 1996. \\na100 year time horizon. \\nI.3 \\nMethodology \\nThis section describes the basic methodology used in this report to analyze potential emissions and \\nabatement of non-CO2 greenhouse gases. The analysis builds on the approach presented in the 2006 \\nGlobal Mitigation of Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases report (USEPA, 2006a). For the current analysis several \\nenhancements were made for the MAC analysis and these will be highlighted in the discussion that \\nfollows. Primary enhancements include: \\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nI-5 \\n\\u2022 \\nUpdating baseline emissions projections \\n\\u2022 \\nDisaggregating mitigation potential and costs to the country level for 195 countries \\n\\u2022 \\nUpdating reduction efficiencies for individual measures by country \\n\\u2022 \\nUpdating capital and operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for individual measures \\n\\u2022 \\nSegmenting O&M costs into labor, materials and energy components \\n\\u2022 \\nDeveloping international adjustments factors used to construct country specific abatement costs \\nand benefits  \\n\\u2022 \\nUpdating crop process model simulations of changes in crop yields and emissions associated \\nwith rice cultivation and cropland soil management  \\nMAC curves are constructed for each region and sector by estimating the carbon price at which the \\npresent value benefits and costs for each mitigation option equilibrates. The methodology produces a \\nstepwise curve, where each point reflects the average price and reduction potential if a mitigation \\ntechnology were applied across the sector within a given region. In conjunction with appropriate baseline \\nand projected emissions for a given sector the results are expressed in terms of absolute reductions of \\ncarbon dioxide equivalents (MtCO2e).This section describes the components of our methodology.  \\nFirst, we establish the baseline emissions for each sector as described in Section I.3.1. Section I.3.2 \\npresents the methodology used to evaluate mitigation options, which involves calculating the abatement \\npotential and the breakeven price for each option. Lastly, we describe the construction of the MACs in \\nSection I.3.3. Some sectors deviate from this methodology depending on specific circumstances, which are \\nbriefly mentioned here and described in more detail in the sector-specific chapters.  \\nThe results of the analysis are presented as MACs by region and by sector and generally focus on the \\n2010 to 2030 time frame. Emissions abatement in the MACs is shown as both absolute emissions \\nreductions and as percentage reductions from the baseline. Non-CO2 emissions sources analyzed in this \\nreport are  \\n\\u2022 \\ncoal mining; \\n\\u2022 \\noil and natural gas systems; \\n\\u2022 \\nsolid waste management; \\n\\u2022 \\nwastewater;  \\n\\u2022 \\nspecialized industrial processes; and \\n\\u2022 \\nagriculture.  \\nI.3.1 \\nBaseline Emissions for Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases \\nFor consistency across regions and sectors the MAC Report analysis primarily uses the EPA report, \\nGlobal Anthropogenic Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 1990-2030 for baseline emissions and projections. \\nThe Global Emissions Report (GER) was published in December of 2012, and uses a combination of \\ncountry-prepared, publicly-available reports (UNFCCC National Communications) and IPCC Tier 1 \\nmethodologies to fill in missing or unavailable data. The basis for the U.S. historical emissions in the GER \\nis the U.S. Inventory of Greenhouse Gases and Sinks published in April of 2011. The methods used to \\nestimate and project non-CO2 emissions in USEPA (2012) are briefly summarized here. In some cases, \\nparticularly for agricultural emissions, it was necessary to develop separate baselines from which to \\nassess the mitigation analyses. For the agricultural sector, the baseline emissions used in this report were \\nbased on crop process model simulations and livestock population data combined with projected crop \\nareas and livestock populations, respectively, from the International Food Policy Research Institute \\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \\nI-6 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nInternational Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) model. These \\ndeviations are also explained in more detail in this report.  \\nThe preferred approach for estimating historical and projected emissions is to use country-prepared, \\npublicly-available reports. EPA applied an overarching methodology to estimate emissions across all \\nsectors, and deviations to this methodology are discussed in each of the source-specific methodology \\nsections of USEPA (2012). The following summary of the general methodology used to estimate global \\nnon-CO2 emissions is replicated from the USEPA (2012) report. \\nHistorical Emissions \\nFor Annex I Countries (A1), the UNFCCC flexible query system (UNFCCC, 2012) provides emission \\nestimates for A1 countries from Common Reporting Format (CRF) files, submitted with annual national \\ninventories. The full or partial time series of source disaggregated data is available for A1 countries from \\n1990 through 2007. The time series is complete for the majority of sources; however there are gaps in the \\ntime series for some countries and categories and data for missing years were supplemented. The \\nmethodology used by each source to interpolate, backcast, or forecast depends on the availability of CRF \\ndata and the distribution of that data over time. In general, the following methodology was applied to \\ninterpolate, backcast, or forecast data:  \\n\\u2022 \\nWhen two years are reported such that a year requiring an estimate (e.g., 1995) occurred between \\nthe reported years (e.g., 1993 and 1997), EPA interpolates the missing estimate (1995) using \\nreported estimates.  \\n\\u2022 \\nEPA backcasted or forecasted emission estimates to complete the historical series for 1990, 1995, \\n2000, and 2005 on a source by source basis. For each source, EPA used growth rates for available \\nactivity data believed to best correlate with emissions (e.g., production, consumption). If either 1) \\nmore than one type of activity data should be used, 2) the emission factor will vary over time, or \\n3) the relationship between the activity data and emissions is not linear (i.e., exponential), then \\nEPA used Tier 1 growth rates. This involves estimating emissions for 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005 \\nusing a Tier 1 approach, then using the rate of growth of this emission estimate to backcast and \\nforecast the country-reported emissions.  \\n\\u2022 \\nIf a country-reported an estimate for an individual source for one year, but reported aggregate \\nestimates for other years, EPA disaggregated the estimates using the percent contribution of the \\nindividual source in the latest reported year.  \\nFor Non-Annex I countries historical emissions data were available in the UNFCCC flexible query \\nsystem as well, but generally these reported data do not constitute a full time series. The methodology for \\ninterpolating or backcasting missing historical data used by each source will follow the same general \\nguidelines outlined in the earlier in this section.  Because the data for non-A1 countries from the \\nUNFCCC flexible query system do not generally have a complete time series, it is likely that non-A1 \\nsources will rely more heavily on Tier 1 calculated growth rates or activity data growth rates for \\nbackcasting and forecasting emissions between 1990 and 2005. \\nProjected Emissions \\nEmission projections by source and country were obtained from National Communications (NCs) \\nreports. For A1 countries, this refers to the Fifth NCs currently being released. For non-A1 countries, EPA \\nreviewed the most recent NCs submitted to the UNFCCC.  \\nIf an NC had projections for a sector but not a source, EPA used the relative proportion of emissions \\nfor the latest year of historical emissions to disaggregate projected emissions for a source. For example, if \\nFrance projected CH4 emissions from agriculture to 2030 but does specify what portion is from manure \\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nI-7 \\nmanagement, EPA took the proportion of emissions that manure contributes to agriculture CH4 emissions \\nin France\\u2019s 2007 GHG Inventory, assume this proportion remains constant for 2030, and apply this to the \\n2030 agriculture estimate.  \\nIf projections for a sector are not available from a NC, EPA used activity data drivers or Tier 1 growth \\nrates, specific to each source. The specific methodology followed by each source category is outlined in \\neach sector\\u2019s methodology description. \\nFor most countries, emissions and projections are not available for the sources of F-GHGs. Therefore, \\nEPA estimates F-GHG emissions and projections using detailed source methodologies described in \\nUSEPA (2012). \\nBaseline Emissions for Agriculture \\nAlthough USEPA (2012) contains estimates of baseline emissions for agricultural sources, alternative \\nbaselines were developed for the purposes of the mitigation report. The primary rationale was to ensure \\nconsistency in the area, number of livestock head, production, and price projections used across the entire \\nagricultural sector. Projections provided by IFPRI from their IMPACT model of global agricultural \\nmarkets were used to adjust values for agricultural activities and associated emissions over time. In \\naddition, detailed process-based models\\u2014Daily Century (DAYCENT) for croplands and DeNitrification\\u2013\\nDeComposition (DNDC) for rice cultivation\\u2014were used for both the baseline emissions estimates and the \\ngreenhouse gas implications of mitigation options, thus allowing for a clear identification of baseline \\nmanagement conditions and consistent estimates of changes to those conditions through mitigation \\nactivities. Emissions obtained using these detailed simulation models differ from those obtained in \\nUSEPA (2012), which relied upon IPCC default emissions factors. For emissions associated with livestock, \\nthe mitigation analysis in this report relies on projections similar to those used in USEPA (2012), but with \\nsome differences due to the adjustments made for consistency with IFPRI IMPACT projections across all \\nagricultural sectors. The baseline emissions were also disaggregated by livestock production system and \\nintensity using data provided by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Further \\ndetails about the emissions baselines estimated by the DAYCENT and DNDC models, and their \\nrelationship to USEPA (2012) estimates, are provided in Section V Agriculture of this report. \\nI.3.2 \\nMitigation Option Analysis Methodology \\nMitigation options represented in the MACs of this report are applied to the baselines described in \\nSection IV.1.3.1. The mitigation option analysis throughout this report was conducted using a common \\nmethodology and framework. This section outlines the basic methodology. The sector-specific chapters \\ndescribe the mitigation estimation methods in greater detail, including any necessary deviations from the \\nbasic methodology.  \\nThe abatement analysis for all non-CO2 gases for agriculture, coal mines, natural gas systems, oil \\nsystems, landfills, wastewater treatment, and nitric and adipic acid production are based on USEPA , \\n2006 and improve upon DeAngelo et al. (2006), Beach et al. (2008), Delhotal et al. (2006), and Ottinger et \\nal. (2006). These studies provided estimates of potential CH4 and N2O emissions reductions from major \\nemitting sectors and quantified costs and benefits of these reductions.  \\nGiven the detailed data available for U.S. sectors, the USEPA\\u2019s U.S. analysis uses representative \\nfacility estimates but then applies the estimates to a highly disaggregated and detailed set of emissions \\nsources for all the major sectors and subsectors. For example, the USEPA analysis of the natural gas sector \\nis based on more than 100 emissions sources in that industry, including gas well equipment, pipeline \\ncompressors and equipment, and system upsets. Thus, the USEPA analysis provides significant detail at \\nthe sector and subsector levels.  \\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \\nI-8 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nThe analysis generally begins with developing sector level model facilities or units to which \\nmitigation options are applied. In many cases the model facilities, abatement costs and mitigation \\npotential are based on detailed US and EU inventory estimates, and then extrapolate to \\u201cmodel\\u201d facilities \\nfor other countries. For some sectors, such as wastewater, landfills, and selected industrial sectors, \\nadditional detail on international abatement options and costs are available and are incorporated into the \\nmodel.  \\nA scaling factor is used to reconcile inventory data with the GER baseline emissions data. For the F-\\nGases abatement analysis, natural gas and oil, and landfills sectors it is assumed that some mitigation \\ntechnologies are adopted to meet future regulations or voluntary industry reduction targets. Therefore, \\nsome mitigation options are accounted for in the baseline emissions. If an option is assumed to be \\nadopted in the baseline, it is not included when generating the MAC. In addition, expert judgment \\ndetermines market shares for mitigation technologies competing for the same set of emissions (when \\nmultiple options are available that are substitutes for each other).  \\nThe agricultural sector\\u2019s emissions abatement analysis improves upon previous studies supported by \\nthe USEPA (USEPA, 2006; DeAngelo et al., 2006; Beach et al., 2008) that generated MACs by major world \\nregion for cropland N2O, livestock enteric CH4, manure management CH4, and rice cultivation CH4. The \\nmost significant change in this report is the use of updated versions of the biophysical, process-based \\nmodels used in previous studies (i.e., DAYCENT and DNDC) applied at a more disaggregated spatial \\nscale to better capture the net greenhouse gas and yield effects and to capture the spatial and temporal \\nvariability of those effects for the cropland and rice emissions baseline and mitigation scenarios. Use of \\nthese process-based models is intended to show broad spatial and temporal baseline trends and broad \\nchanges when mitigation scenarios are introduced, rather than to show definitive absolute emissions \\nnumbers for specific locations. In addition, baseline emissions estimates have been updated and a larger \\nnumber of mitigation options are now assessed, particularly for rice cultivation (e.g., increased emphasis \\non options that reduce N2O as well as CH4). Considerably greater disaggregation of the baseline by \\nproduction system has been incorporated to improve our ability to characterize technical applicability for \\ndifferent types of livestock and cropping systems. More detailed results are provided for rice cultivation \\nunder deepwater, upland, rainfed, and irrigated conditions, with separate calculations for alternative \\nirrigated water management strategies and for livestock management based on livestock production \\nsystem and management intensity.  \\nTechnical Characteristics of Abatement Options \\nThe non-CO2 abatement options evaluated in this report are compiled from the studies mentioned \\nabove, as well as from the literature relevant for each sector. For each region, either the entire set of \\nsector-specific options or the subset of options determined to be applicable is applied. Options are \\nomitted from individual regions on a case-by-case basis, using either expert knowledge of the region or \\ntechnical and physical factors (e.g., appropriate climate conditions). In addition, the share or extent of \\napplicability of an option within different regions may vary based on these conditions.  \\nThe selective omission of options represents a static view of the region\\u2019s socioeconomic conditions. In \\nsome instances the reduction efficiency of an option improves over time reflecting anticipated technology \\nadvances. However, the applicability of options is held constant over time. Ideally, more detailed \\ninformation on country-specific conditions, technologies, and experiences will be available in the future, \\nwhich will enable more rigorous analyses of abatement option availability over time in each region. In \\naddition, the average technical lifetime of an option (in years), determined using expert knowledge of the \\ntechnology or recent literature, is held constant over time and across regions. \\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nI-9 \\nTable I-3 summarizes how the potential emission reduction is calculated for each of the available \\nabatement options. First the technical effectiveness of each option is calculated by multiplying the options \\ntechnical applicability by its market share by its reduction efficiency. This yields the percentage of \\nbaseline emissions that can be reduced at the national or regional level by a given option. This is then \\napplied to the Emissions stream (MtCO2e) to which the option is applied to yield the emissions \\nreductions for the mitigation option.  \\nTable I-3: \\nCalculation of Potential Emission Reduction for an Abatement Option \\nTechnical \\nApplicability \\n \\n(%) \\nX \\nMarket \\n \\nSharea (%) \\nX \\nReduction \\nEfficiency \\n \\n(%) \\n= \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTechnical \\nEffectiveness \\n(%) \\nTechnical \\nEffectiveness \\n(%) \\nX \\nBaseline Unit \\nEmissions \\n(MtCO2e) \\n \\n= \\nUnit \\nEmission \\nReduction \\n(MtCO2e) \\nPercentage of \\ntotal baseline \\nemissions from \\na particular \\nemissions \\nsource to which \\na given option \\ncan be \\npotentially \\napplied. \\n \\nPercentage of \\ntechnically \\napplicable \\nbaseline \\nemissions to \\nwhich a given \\noption is \\napplied; \\navoids double \\ncounting \\namong \\ncompeting \\noptions \\n \\nPercentage of \\ntechnically \\nachievable \\nemissions \\nabatement \\nfor an option \\nafter it is \\napplied to a \\ngiven \\nemissions \\nstream \\n \\nPercentage of \\nbaseline \\nemissions that \\ncan be \\nreduced at the \\nnational or \\nregional level by \\na given \\noption. \\n \\nEmissions \\nstream to \\nwhich the \\noption is \\napplied \\n \\nUnit \\nemission \\nreductions \\na Implied market share non competing options (i.e., only one options is applicable for an emissions streams) is assumed to add to 100 percent  \\nTechnical applicability accounts for the portion of emissions from a facility or region that a mitigation \\noption could feasibly reduce based on its application. For example, if an option applies only to the \\nunderground portion of emissions from coal mining, then the technical applicability for the option would \\nbe the percentage of emissions from underground mining relative to total emissions from coal mining.  \\nThe implied market share of an option is a mathematical adjustment for other qualitative factors that \\nmay influence the effectiveness or adoption of a mitigation option. For certain energy, waste, and \\nagriculture sectors, it was outside the scope of this analysis to account for adoption feasibility, such as \\nsocial acceptance and alternative permutations in the sequencing of adoption. For example, if n \\ncompeting (overlapping) mitigation options are available for a single emissions stream, the implied \\nmarket share of each of the n overlapping options is equal to 1/n. This avoids cumulative reductions of \\ngreater than 100 percent across options. Given the lack of region-specific data for determining the relative \\nlevel of diffusion among options that could compete for the same emissions stream, we applied this \\nconservative adjustment. An example of overlapping options is the sequencing of cropland mitigation \\noptions, where the adoption of one option (e.g., conversion to no tillage) affects the effectiveness of \\nsubsequent options (e.g., reduced fertilizer applications). While this describes the basic application of the \\nimplied adoption rate in the energy, waste, and agriculture sectors, this factor is informed by expert \\ninsight into the potential market penetration over time in the industrial processes sector. For sectors such \\nas landfills, where market share assumptions are available, customized shares that sum to one are used \\ninstead of 1/n. \\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \\nI-10 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nWhen nonoverlapping options are applied, they affect 100 percent of baseline emissions from the \\nrelevant source. Examples of two nonoverlapping options in the natural gas system are inspection and \\nmaintenance of compressors and replacement of distribution pipes. These options are applied \\nindependently to different parts of the sector and do not compete for the same emissions stream.  \\nThe reduction efficiency of a mitigation option is the percentage reduction achieved with adoption. \\nThe reduction efficiency is applied to the relevant baseline emissions as defined by technical applicability \\nand adoption effectiveness. Most abatement options, when adopted, reduce an emissions stream less than \\n100 percent. If multiple options are available for the same component, the total reduction for that \\ncomponent is less than 100 percent. \\nOnce the technical effectiveness of an option is calculated as described above, this percentages \\nmultiplied by the baseline emissions for each sector and region to calculate the absolute amount of \\nemissions reduced by employing the option. The absolute amount of baseline emissions reduced by an \\noption in a given year is expressed in million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2eq).1\\nIf the options are assumed to be technically feasible in a given region, the options are assumed to be \\nimplemented immediately, Furthermore, once options are adopted, they are assumed to remain in place \\nfor the duration of the analysis, and an option\\u2019s parameters are not changed over its lifetime.  \\nEconomic Characteristics of Abatement Options \\nEach abatement option is characterized in terms of its costs and benefits per an abated unit of gas \\n(tCO2eq or tons of emitted gas [e.g., tCH4]). The benefits include a carbon value/price expressed as \\n$/tCO-2e. The carbon price at which an option\\u2019s benefits equal the costs is referred to as the option\\u2019s \\nbreakeven price. \\nFor each mitigation option, the carbon price (P) at which that option becomes economically viable is \\ncalculated using the equation below (i.e., where the present value of the benefits of the option equals the \\npresent value of the costs of implementing the option). A present value analysis of each option is used to \\ndetermine breakeven abatement costs in a given region. Breakeven calculations are independent of the \\nyear the mitigation option is implemented but are contingent on the life expectancy of the option. The net \\npresent value calculation solves for breakeven price P, by equating the present value of the benefits with \\nthe present value of the costs of the mitigation option.

In most cases, there are two price signals for the abatement of CH4: one price based on \\nCH4\\u2019s value as energy (because natural gas is 95 percent CH4) and one price based on CH4\\u2019s value as a \\ngreenhouse gas. All cost and benefit values are expressed in constant year 2010 U.S. dollars. This analysis \\nis conducted using a 10 percent discount rate and a 40 percent tax rate.

For the agricultural sector, labor, energy, water and \\nother input costs are calculated from their shares of agricultural production costs based on social \\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \\nI-12 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\naccounting matrix (SAM) data from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) v8 database and \\nagricultural wage data from the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). \\nIn regions where there is a lack of detailed revenue (benefits) data, revenues are scaled based on the \\nratio between average prices of natural gas (when CH4 is abated and sold as natural gas) or of electricity \\n(when CH4 is used to generate electricity or heat) in a given region and in the United States. Similarly, \\nrevenues from non-CH4 benefits of abatement options are scaled based on the ratio between the GDPs per \\ncapita in a given region and in the United States. In the agricultural sector, changes in revenue occur as a \\nchange in either crop yield or livestock productivity.

These \\u201cbelow-the-line\\u201d amounts represent mitigation options that are \\nalready cost-effective given the costs and benefits considered (and are sometimes referred to as \\u201cno-\\nregret\\u201d options) yet have not been implemented. However, there may be nonmonetary barriers that are \\npreventing their adoption.  \\nThe MACs in this report are constructed from bottom-up average breakeven price calculations. The \\naverage breakeven price is calculated for the estimated abatement potential for each mitigation option \\n(see Section I.). The options are then ordered in ascending order of breakeven price (cost) and plotted \\nagainst abatement potential. The resulting MAC is a stepwise function, rather than a smooth curve, as \\nseen in the illustrative MAC (Figure I-2), because each point on the curve represents the breakeven price \\npoint for a discrete mitigation option (or defined bundle of mitigation strategies). \\nConceptually, marginal costs are the incremental costs of an additional unit of abatement. However, \\nthe abatement cost curves developed here reflect the incremental costs of adopting the next cost-effective \\nmitigation option. We estimated the costs and benefits associated with all or nothing adoption of each \\nwell-defined mitigation practice. We did not estimate the marginal costs of incremental changes within \\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \\nI-14 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\neach practice (e.g., the net cost associated with an incremental change in paddy rice irrigation). Instead, \\nthe MACs developed in this report reflect the average net cost of each option for the achieved reduction \\u2013 \\nhence the noncontinuous, stepwise nature of the curve. \\nIn the energy and waste sectors, representative facilities facing varied mitigation costs employ \\nmitigation technologies based on the lowest average breakeven option price. In calculating the abatement \\npotential, options are evaluated according to whether they are complements or substitutes. If a group of \\noptions are complements (or independent of one another), the implied market shares are all equal to one. \\nIf options are substitutes for each other, then market shares that sum to one are used to distribute \\nadoption across the available options (see table I.3). In some instances, the lowest price option is selected \\nfor each representative facility. When limited information is available, the market share is evenly \\ndistributed (1/n) across all viable options. In this way, the implied adoption rate for each technology is \\nestimated.  \\nIn the industrial processes sector, mitigation options are applied to representative facilities, in order \\nof lowest average breakeven price to highest average breakeven price. Each option is applied to a portion \\nof the baseline emissions based on the implied adoption rate (the market share factor, as described in \\nSection I.3.2.2), which, in the industrial sector, is informed by expert insight into potential adoption rates \\nof various mitigation technologies.  \\nIn the agriculture sector, mitigation options are applied to the portion of emissions where they are \\ntechnically applicable (e.g., anaerobic digesters are assumed to be applicable only in intensively managed \\ndairy and hog production systems). The implied market share for competing options is based purely on \\nthe number of available migration options (n) that are applicable to a given subset of emissions and that \\nreduce emissions2 (1/n), where each option is applied to an equal portion of the cropland base or \\nlivestock population and, thus regional baseline emissions, for each region over time. Given the existence \\nof nonprice and implementation factors that influence market share and the lack of accurate and detailed \\ninformation regarding these qualitative characteristics, we assume an even distribution of options across \\nthe relevant baseline for the agriculture sector. This approach allows options to share a portion of market \\npenetration, regardless of their cost-effectiveness, rather than allowing only the least-cost option to \\ncompletely dominate the market. Our methodology is more conservative than if we had assumed only \\nprice factors exist, thus allowing the least-cost option to penetrate the sector by 100 percent.  \\nThe MACs represent the average economic potential of mitigation technologies in that sector, because \\nit is assumed that if a mitigation technology is technically feasible in a given region, then it is \\nimplemented according to the relevant economic conditions. Therefore, the MACs do not represent the \\nmarket potential or the social acceptance of a technology. The models used in the analysis are static (i.e., \\nthey do not represent adoption of mitigation technologies over time). This analysis assumes partial \\nequilibrium conditions that do not represent economic feedbacks from the input or output markets. This \\nanalysis makes no assumptions regarding a policy environment that might encourage the \\nimplementation of mitigation options. Additional discussion of some key limitations of the methodology \\nis provided in Section I.5.  \\n                                                           \\n2 Some agricultural mitigation options may increase emissions under certain conditions depending on baseline \\nregional management and soil, climate, and other considerations. In addition, there are many mitigation options that \\nincrease emissions per head of livestock or per hectare of land, but reduce emissions intensity per unit of output. \\nThus, agricultural MACs are calculated both assuming constant production and constant area/head of livestock to \\npresent a range of potential mitigation. The options that provide net emissions reductions may differ between these \\nalternative methods of MAC generation.  \\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nI-15 \\nThe end result of this analysis is a tabular data set for the MACs by sector, gas, and region, which are \\npresented in Appendix A.3 Sectoral MACs are aggregated by gas and by region to create global MACs, \\nwhich are presented in Section I.4.2.  \\nI.3.4 \\nMethodological Enhancements from Analysis  \\nThis report builds on a study previously conducted by the USEPA for Stanford\\u2019s EMF-21 and the \\nUSEPA (2006) report. The EMF-21 focused specifically on multigas strategies and the incorporation of \\nnon-CO2 greenhouse gas data sets into economic models. Although this analysis is built largely on the \\nprevious USEPA analysis for the EMF-21, we have made several key enhancements.  \\nNew mitigation options have been added to the analysis for coal mining, agriculture, natural gas and \\noil systems sectors. This report also presents MAC curves for the domestic wastewater sector, flat panel \\ndisplay production, and photovoltaic cell production, which were not available in the previous report.  \\nFor industrial sources of fluorinated gases, the emissions baselines have been updated since the EMF-\\n21 analysis. In addition, the MACs for aluminum manufacturing and electrical power systems have been \\nenhanced with additional data.  \\nThe emissions baselines in the ODS substitute sector have also been enhanced. The EMF-21 ODS \\nsubstitute baseline was an average between baselines derived by the USEPA and ECOFYS. For this \\nreport, the USEPA has generated an updated baseline. Assumptions in the ODS substitute sector, such as \\nthe market penetration potential of various mitigation options, have been updated from the EMF-21 \\nanalysis based on the input of industry experts.  \\nIn the agricultural sector, the previous methodology is improved on for this analysis by using \\nupdated versions of the biophysical, process-based models DAYCENT and DNDC that are utilized at a \\nmore spatially disaggregated level and with a more disaggregated set of baseline management types to \\nwhich these options can be applied. These models capture the net greenhouse gas effects of the cropland \\nand rice baseline emissions and mitigation options, and they reflect the heterogeneous emissions and \\nyield effects of adopting mitigation practices. In addition, new agricultural mitigation options are now \\nassessed, and more detailed results are provided for alternative baseline crop and livestock management \\npractices.  \\nI.4 \\nAggregate Results \\nGlobal total non-CO2 greenhouse gas baseline emissions in 2010 are estimated at 11,389 MtCO2e, and \\nprojected to increase 33% by 2030, totaling 15,157 MtCO2e. Non-CO2 anthropogenic emissions come from \\nfour major emitting sectors: the energy, waste management, industrial processes, and agricultural \\nindustries. China, United States, Russia, India and Brazil are the 5 largest country emitters and account \\nfor 40% of total emissions. \\nThis section presents the projected baseline emissions for non-CO2 anthropogenic greenhouse gases \\nand provides a global overview of the MAC analysis results by sector and top emitting countries and \\nregions from 2010-2030.

Figures I-5 and I-6 provide the projected global baseline emission \\nfor 2010, 2020, 2030, by major emissions sector and by major emitting region, respectively. The agriculture \\nsector includes soil and manure management, rice cultivation, enteric fermentation, and other \\nnonindustrial sources such as biomass burning. Emissions sources categorized in the energy sector \\ninclude coal mining activities, natural gas transmission and distribution, and gas and oil production. The \\nwaste sector includes municipal solid waste management, as well as human sewage and other types of \\nwastewater treatment. The industrial processes sector includes a wide range of activities, such as \\nsemiconductor manufacturing, primary aluminum production, and electricity transmission and \\ndistribution.  \\nAgriculture is the primary source of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 45 percent of \\nthe total 2010 baseline. Energy holds the second largest share of non-CO2 emissions, representing 23 \\npercent of the baseline. The waste and industrial processes sectors represent 11 and 7 percent, \\nrespectively. This trend will change through 2030, however, as emissions from the industrial processes \\nsector is projected to increase by more than double, and will therefore produce more non-CO2 emissions \\nthat waste by 2030. \\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \\nI-18 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES Figure 1-5.

As \\ndiscussed in the 2006 version of this report, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Assessing \\nTransaction Costs of Project-based Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading (Antinori and Sathaye 2007), which \\nreported that transactions costs range between $0.03 per metric ton of carbon dioxide for large projects to \\n$4.05 per ton of carbon dioxide for smaller projects, with a weighted average of $0.36 per tonne of carbon \\ndioxide for a suite of projects considered. More recent MAC work by others (Rose, et al. 2013) estimated \\nthe unit cost of an abatement project increases by an average of 15% when transaction costs are included. \\nTransaction costs vary significantly, contingent on the size of the project, the applicable mitigation \\ntechnology, and other factors. Given the lack of comprehensive data, this analysis continues to exclude \\ntransaction costs from the analysis.  \\nI.5.2 \\nStatic Approach to Abatement Assessment \\nThis analysis does not account for the technological change in such option characteristics as \\navailability, reduction efficiency, applicability, and costs. For example, the same sets of options are \\napplied in 2010 and 2030 and an option\\u2019s parameters are not changed over its lifetime. This current \\nlimitation likely underestimates abatement potential because technologies generally improve over time \\nand costs fall. The introduction of a dynamic approach to assessing regional abatement potentials \\nrequires additional assumptions about rates of technological progress and better baseline projections, \\nthat, once incorporated into this analysis, will yield a better representation of how MACs change over \\nspace and time. Developing more dynamic MACs to capture the impacts of technological change should \\nbe included in any future MAC development. \\nI.5.3 \\nLimited Use of Regional Data \\nThe analytic framework used in this study is flexible enough to incorporate regional differences in all \\nthe characteristics of abatement options. However, a lack of country-specific data led to a reliance on \\nexpert judgment, as noted in the sector-specific chapters. This expert judgment was obtained from \\nsource-level technical experts in government and industry with knowledge of project-level technologies, \\ncosts, and specific regional conditions. Applicability of abatement options, for example, is reliant on \\nexpert judgment, because the makeup of the current infrastructure in a given country in a given sector is \\nuncertain. A much greater use of data originating from local experts and organizations is recommended \\nfor the follow-up research of CH4 abatement in countries outside the United States and EU. Incorporating \\nmore regional data could also enhance the range of emissions sources and mitigation options addressed \\nin this analysis. \\nI.5.4 \\nExclusion of Indirect Emissions Reductions \\nThis analysis does not account for indirect emissions reductions, which can result from either the \\nsubstitution of electricity from the grid, with electricity produced on-site from recovered CH4, or from the \\nsubstitution of natural gas in pipelines with recovered CH4. Calculation of such indirect reductions \\nrequires additional assumptions about the carbon intensity of electricity in different regions. In the U.S. \\nlandfill sector, indirect reductions generally augment emissions reductions by about 15 percent. In the \\nagricultural sector, although some mitigation options primarily target a single gas, implementation of the \\nmitigation options will have multiple greenhouse gas effects, most of which are reflected in the \\nagricultural results.  \\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY \\nI-22 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nReferences \\nAntinori, C. and J.

Coal is an important \\nenergy resource in many of the world\\u2019s economies, used for energy generation or as a \\nfeedstock in industrial production processes. Extracting this energy resource through \\nunderground and surface mining releases methane (CH4) stored in the coal bed and surrounding geologic \\nstrata. The U.S. Energy Information Administration\\u2019s (USEIA\\u2019s) (2011) most recent international energy \\noutlook projects a 39% increase in coal production between 2010 and 2035, reflecting continued economic \\nand industrial development of the world\\u2019s emerging economies. In the absence of widespread adoption \\nof abatement measures by the coal mining sector, expanding coal production to meet growing energy \\ndemands will subsequently lead to increases in anthropogenic emissions. \\nCOAL MINING \\nII-2 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nCapture for use or destruction are two alternative abatement measures that can mitigate CH4 \\nemissions associated with underground mining. For mines that are able to utilize the recovered gas, the \\ncaptured methane represents a potential revenue stream that may offset a portion of the cost of \\nimplementing the abatement measure. Specifically, three categories of abatement measures are \\nconsidered: (1) gas recovery for energy end uses; (2) combustion through flaring; and (3) ventilation air \\nmethane (VAM) recovery and destruction through thermal or catalytic oxidation, where low \\nconcentrations of CH4 present in ventilation air exhaust flows are oxidized. \\nGlobal abatement potential that is technologically achievable from underground coal mining based \\non the abatement measures considered is approximately 60% of total annual emissions in 2030. Marginal \\nabatement cost (MAC) curve results are presented in Figure 1-2 for 2010, 2020, and 2030. Maximum \\nabatement potential in the coal mining sector is 400 and 468 MtCO2e in 2020 and 2030 respectively.  \\nFigure 1-2: \\nGlobal Abatement Potential in Coal Mining: 2010, 2020, and 2030 \\n \\n2010\\n2020\\n2030\\n$60\\n$50\\n$40\\n$30\\n e\\n2\\n$20\\nO\\nC\\nt\\n$/\\n$10\\n$0\\n0\\n100\\n200\\n300\\n400\\n500\\n-$10\\n-$20\\n-$30\\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\nWhile maximum abatement could only be achieved at higher carbon prices, the MAC results suggest \\nthat significant opportunities for CH4 reductions in the coal mining sector at carbon prices at or below \\n$10. Furthermore there are approximately 78 MtCO2e of reductions that are cost-effective at currently \\nprojected energy prices. These reductions are sometimes referred to as no-regret options. \\nThe following section offers a brief explanation of how CH4 is emitted from coal mines, followed by a \\ndiscussion of projected trends in international baseline emissions. Section II.1.3 characterizes possible \\nabatement technologies, outlining their technical specifications, costs and possible benefits, and potential \\nin selected countries. The final section of this chapter discusses emissions reductions that occur following \\nthe implementation of each abatement technology and how these reductions are reflected in the MACs. \\n COAL MINING \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nII-3 \\nII.1.2 \\nMethane Emissions from Coal Mining \\nMethane is produced during a natural process that converts organic material into coal. Methane is \\nstored in the coal through a physical process referred to as sorption. Sorbed methane is condensed within \\nthe matrix of the coal as long as the hydrostatic pressure is maintained, but during the mining process, \\nthe pressure drops and the gas will begin to desorb and flow into the mine\\u2019s workings. Methane is also \\nstored in the free spaces of the coal strata and migrates to the mine workings. Many factors affect the \\nquantity of CH4 released, including the gas content of the coal, the permeability and porosity of the coal \\nseams, the method of mining used, and the production capacity of the mining operation. The \\nconcentration of methane present in the coal seam depends on several factors but generally increases with \\ndepth. There are four major sources of CH4 emissions in the coal sector including underground mines, \\nsurface mines, post-mining processing, and abandoned mines. Underground mining is the largest single \\nsource of emissions in the sector. \\nUnderground Mines. High concentrations of CH4 in underground coal mines is a safety hazard. Mines \\nare ventilated by use of large fans which are capable of moving large volumes of air through the active \\nworkings. Air is drawn across the working face, where coal is being extracted, and exhausted to the \\natmosphere. This is often adequate to maintain safe levels of methane in the mine workings. \\nIn especially gassy mines, the ventilation system may be supplemented by degasification systems, to \\nensure adequate evacuation of methane from the mine to ensure safe working conditions. Degasification \\nsystems are necessary to ensure safe operations in highly gas prone underground mines that are \\nsusceptible to gas outbursts and high methane emissions encountered at the mining face. The primary \\nmethods to reduce emissions at the mining face include pre-mine drainage systems that reduce the \\nmethane pressure in the coal seam, thereby reducing both the total volume of methane emitted at the \\nmining face and the rate at which it is emitted and post-mining boreholes which drain methane from the \\ncollapsed and fractured zone (gob) behind the mining face. These reduce the concentration of methane, \\nespecially near the active mining coal face. \\nDegasification systems consist of a network of boreholes drilled from the surface, or within the mine \\nfor the purpose of removing CH4 before, during, or after mining. These wells extract coal mine methane \\nfrom the coal seam at relatively high concentrations (30% to 90%). Concentrations vary depending on the \\ntype of coal mined and the degasification technique used. In contrast, underground mine ventilation \\nsystems emit large quantities of very dilute methane (typically less than 1% methane), known as \\n\\u201cventilation air methane\\u201d or VAM. \\nTraditionally, CH4 extracted from the mine is released or vented into the atmosphere. It is possible to \\nmitigate underground mine methane emissions, especially from degasification systems, by capturing the \\ngas and either flaring it or recovering and using it for energy. In the case of VAM, the relatively low CH4 \\nconcentration makes it more challenging both technically and economically to mitigate it or recover \\nenergy from it. \\nSurface Mines. Surface mining is a technique used to extract coal from shallow depths at or below the \\nEarth\\u2019s surface. Because the hydrostatic pressure at shallow depths is lower, the in situ CH4 content is not \\nas high at surface mines as at underground mines. CH4 emissions from surface mines (expressed as \\nvolume of CH4 per mass of coal mined) are typically less than from underground mines. As the overlying \\nsoil and rock is removed and the coal exposed, CH4 is emitted directly into the atmosphere. Both because \\nof its lower methane contents and because surface mining is only applicable in certain geographic \\nregions, surface mines may contribute only a small fraction of a country\\u2019s overall emissions. For example, \\nin the United States in 2009, surface mining accounted for over 60% of coal production, while only \\nCOAL MINING \\nII-4 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\naccounting for 18% of CH4 emissions from coal mining (USEPA, 2011b). In China, there is very little \\nsurface mining whereas in India almost all coal production is from surface mines. The only technically \\nfeasible abatement measures available to surface mining are pre-mine methane drainage in advance of \\nmining, similar to coal bed methane (CBM) recovery operations (USEPA, 2008a), or horizontal boreholes \\ninto a high wall where the operation starts as a surface mine but eventually the drift requires the \\noperation to become an underground mine. Given the limited contribution surface mines make to \\nnational baseline emissions, this analysis did not consider any abatement measures for surface mining. \\nPost-mining Operations. Following the mining operations, a series of operations, called post-mining \\noperations, constitutes a third source of CH4 emissions. Not all CH4 gas is released from coal during the \\nprocess of coal breakage that takes place during extraction and transport to the surface at mining \\noperations; some emissions occur during the processing, storage, and transport of coal as the coal \\ncontinues to de-gas. The rate of post-mining emissions depends on the rank of coal and the way it is \\nhandled. The highest rate of emissions occurs when coal is crushed, sized, and dried for industrial and \\nutility uses. Given the limited contribution of post-mining emissions to national baseline emissions and \\nthe limited technical options to abate these emissions from rail cars or storage piles, this analysis does not \\nconsider any abatement measures for post-mining operations. \\nAbandoned Mines. Abandoned mines are another source of CH4 emissions. Emissions are released \\nthrough old wells, ventilation shafts, and cracks and fissures in overlying strata. In some cases, the CH4 \\nfrom these mines has been captured and used as a source of natural gas or to generate electricity. The \\n2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines provide a separate methodology for \\nreporting emissions from abandoned coal mines. Hence, emissions from this source are excluded from \\nthis analysis and are not included in the baseline estimates. Although there are abatement options for \\nrecovering and using methane from abandoned mines, these options were not examined in this analysis. \\nIn summary, the majority of the CH4 emitted from coal mining operations comes from gassy \\nunderground mines via ventilation systems and degasification systems. Smaller, but still significant, \\namounts of CH4 are emitted from surface mining and post-mining operations and from abandoned mines. \\nFuture levels of CH4 emissions from coal mining, however, will be primarily determined by the \\nmanagement of CH4 gas at active underground mines. \\nII.1.2.1 \\nActivity Data and Related Assumptions \\nGlobally, coal production is expected to increase by 39% from 2010 to 2035, growing at an average \\nannual rate of 1.8%. Future baseline CH4 emissions estimates are directly related to projections of future \\nlevels of coal production. Projected coal production is based on global trends in the demand and supply \\nof coal, which are particularly influenced by the global mix of electricity generation sources. China and \\nIndia are expected to account for 72% of the increase in global production as they try to meet their \\ndemand with domestically produced coal (USEIA, 2011). \\nThree quarters of the world\\u2019s recoverable coal reserves are located in five countries: the United States \\n(27%), Russia (18%), China (13%), Australia (9%), and India (7%) (USEIA, 2011). Because global coal \\nconsumption is projected to increase over the next several decades, it is also expected that these five \\ncountries will produce the majority of coal to meet the demand. Efforts in recent years by China to \\nmodernize its coal mining operations are allowing coal to be mined at greater depths and at lower cost. \\nThis, combined with a tremendous demand for coal-generated electricity, has contributed to substantial \\nincreases in CH4 emissions. \\nEmissions factors for coal mining vary depending on the type of coal being mined, the depth at \\nwhich the mining face is located, and how much coal is being produced in a given year. These factors also \\n COAL MINING \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nII-5 \\nvary across countries and time. Emissions factors are estimated for each country and are based on the \\nmethodologies detailed in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

For additional \\ndetail on historical emissions estimates we refer the reader to USEPA\\u2019s Global Emissions Report (2012). \\nProjected Emissions Estimates \\nAbsent the widespread adoption of abatement technologies, worldwide global CH4 emissions from \\ncoal mining will continue to increase at an accelerated rate. Over the next 20 years, emissions are \\nexpected to grow at an average annual rate of 1.5%, compared with 0.07% between 1990 and 2010. The \\nprojected increase is driven by a number of factors, including continued mining technology advances and \\nincreasing demand for coal for electricity production over the same period. Large, increasingly developed \\ncountries, such as China and India, are expected to experience high levels of economic growth. Economic \\n2 Emissions factors for underground mines, the largest source of CH4 emissions from coal mining, are the same as \\nthose described in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, and emissions factors \\nfor surface mines, post-mining, and abandoned mines are all based on the IPCC\\u2019s 2006 guidelines. \\n3 For more detail on baseline development and estimation methodology, the authors refer the reader to the USEPA\\u2019s \\nGlobal Emissions Projection Report available at: www.epa.gov/climatechange/economics/international.html. \\nCOAL MINING \\nII-6 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\ngrowth in these countries will be the biggest driver of future CH4 emissions from coal mining.

It should be noted that mitigation of gas from degasification \\nsystems and ventilation systems are independent of each other. Abatement measures in the coal mining \\nsector consist of one or more of the following primary components: (1) a drainage and recovery system \\n(where applicable) to remove methane from the coal seam pre-mining or from the gob area post mining, \\n(2) the end-use application for the gas recovered from the drainage system (where applicable), and (3) the \\nventilation air methane recovery or mitigation system (where applicable). \\nCosts are derived from USEPA\\u2019s Coalbed Methane Outreach Program (CMOP) project Cash Flow \\nModel (USEPA, 2011b) and applied to a representative population of underground mines.

Approximately one-third4 of total mine emissions can be \\nrecovered through degasification (also commonly referred to as drainage), while the majority of mine \\nemissions are released at low concentrations in the ventilation air referred to as VAM. \\nRecovery efficiency [B] relates to the collection system (see Section II.1.3.1) itself and reflects what \\nmay be recovered through the drainage wells or ventilation exhaust systems. Only a fraction of the total \\ndrained CH4 may be effectively used or destroyed because of natural variances in the volume and \\nconcentration of methane collected. With respect to VAM oxidation, for this analysis recovery efficiency \\nis set at 25% in 2010 and grows to 90% by 2030. \\nTechnical feasibility [C] relates to the physical or technical limitations of the technologies. It is \\ntechnically feasible to safely combust mine gas with CH4 concentrations greater than 30% for drained gas \\nor 0.25% for VAM. A value of 77% for VAM represents the fraction of exhaust vents with methane \\nconcentrations high enough (>0.25%) to allow for oxidation.5 Finally, the reduction efficiency [D] is the \\nfactor that describes the destruction efficiency of each end use or combustion technology. For pipeline \\ninjection, the reduction efficiency represents the methane losses that occur during transport from the \\nmine to the point of sale into a natural gas pipeline. \\nII.1.3.1 \\nMethane Recovery System from Degasification/Drainage Systems \\nHigh-quality CH4 is recovered from coal seams by drilling vertical wells from the surface up to 10 \\nyears in advance of a mining operation or drilling in-mine horizontal boreholes several months or years \\nbefore mining. Most mine operators exercise just-in-time management of gate road development; \\nsubsequently, horizontal cross-panel boreholes are installed and drain gas for 6 months or less (USEPA, \\n2011b). \\nThe components of the capital and annual costs for the drainage wells are outlined as given in \\nUSEPA\\u2019s CMOP Cash Flow Model documentation (USEPA, 2011b). The recovery system includes the \\nequipment required for drainage wells, gas gathering lines, and delivery systems for coal mine methane \\n(CMM). The recovery system is included in the costs of all abatement measures with the exception of \\nVAM oxidation.6 These costs are additive to the costs associated with each abatement measure. \\n\\u2022 \\nCapital Cost: The capital costs for a drainage system are a function of the recovered gas flow rate. \\nEquipment requirements include construction of the drainage well(s), a wellhead blower, a \\nsatellite compressor station, and gathering pipelines that connect the compressors to the methane \\nend-use technology. The total installed capital costs will vary by location and gas flow rate. For \\nexample, assuming a 600 Mcf/day volume of CMM gas (with a CH4 concentration of 90%), we \\nestimate the capital costs would be $850,000. See Appendix B for additional detail on equipment \\ncost assumptions. \\n4 The proportion of mine CH4 emissions recoverable through degasification systems can vary from 0% to 70% \\ndepending on the gassiness of the mine. This analysis uses 38%, which represents an average for gassy mines. \\n5 This value may be a high estimate based on anecdotal evidence from field testing experience. For example, the \\nnumber of mines in Asia that meets a threshold for application of available and field-tested VAM abatement systems \\nis much lower. \\n6 A recovery system is not required for VAM oxidation because it relies on the mine\\u2019s existing ventilation system that \\nwould be installed before mining operations commence. \\n COAL MINING \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nII-9 \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual Operating and Maintenance (O&M) Costs: The annual costs are required to maintain \\nthe drainage system equated to approximately $2.2/Mcf per year. These costs include the ongoing \\ninstallation of gob wells and the gathering system piping that connects the wells to satellite \\ncompressors. In keeping with the example mine of 600 Mcf/day, the annual O&M costs associated \\nwith the recovery system would be approximately $475,000. \\n\\u2022 \\nRecovery Efficiency: Recovery efficiency is assumed to be 75%. \\nII.1.3.2 \\nDegasification for Utilization in Energy Production \\nThis category of abatement measures includes (1) recovery for pipeline injection and (2) recovery for \\nelectricity generation. Both options require a recovery system in place to extract the methane gas from the \\ncoal seams. Which technology is most cost-effective will be determined by a combination of regional \\nenergy prices and the capital equipment requirements. \\nDegasification for Pipeline Injection \\nNatural gas companies may purchase CH4 recovered from coal mines. CH4 suitable for sale into \\nnatural gas pipelines must have a concentration of at least 96% and contain no more than 4% \\nconcentration of noncombustible gases with a maximum of 4% carbon dioxide or nitrogen and 1 ppm \\noxygen. Although CH4 from coal mines requires water removal, it is typically free of hydrogen sulfide \\nand other impurities found in natural gas. Hence, little to no additional treatment and processing are \\nnecessary to meet the requirements for pipeline injection. In some cases, high-quality CH4 also can be \\nobtained from gob wells. \\nPremining degas wells are the preferred recovery method for producing pipeline quality CH4 from \\ncoal seams because the recovered methane is not contaminated with ventilation air from the working \\nareas of the mine. \\nGob wells, in contrast, generally do not produce pipeline-quality gas because the methane is \\nfrequently mixed with ventilation air. Gob gas CH4 concentrations can range from 30% to over 90%. It is \\npossible to upgrade gob gas for pipeline quality although blending with pre-mine drained gas and/or \\noxygen removal may be necessary, adding to the cost of gas processing. However, it is possible to \\nmaintain a higher and more consistent gas quality through careful monitoring and adjustment of the \\nvacuum pressure in gob wells as has been demonstrated in the United States (USEPA, 2008b). \\nThe viability of a pipeline project is affected by several key factors. First is a coal mine\\u2019s proximity to \\na commercial pipeline. The cost of constructing a pipeline to connect to a commercial pipeline can vary \\ngreatly depending on distance. Secondly, and more importantly, the terrain will affect the viability of a \\ncommercial pipeline project. Many mining areas are located in hilly and mountainous regions, thus \\nincreasing the difficulty and cost of constructing both gathering lines and pipeline to connect to the \\ncommercial natural gas pipeline (USEPA, 2008b). Finally, disposal of water produced from vertical wells \\nmay be a significant factor in determining the economic viability of a pipeline project. \\n\\u2022 \\nInitial Capital Cost: The per facility installed capital costs for pipeline injection of gob gas, as \\ndescribed in USEPA (2011b), include the installation of a pressure swing adsorption system to \\nremove nitrogen and carbon dioxide down to a 4% inert level. The utilization cost is a function of \\nboth the inlet gas flow rate and methane concentration and includes the cost of dehydration and \\ncompression necessary to process the gas and boost the sales gas to pressure for injection in a \\nnatural gas transmission pipeline. While there may be a range of pressures at which pipelines \\noperate, this analysis assumes an operating pressure of 900 psig. This option also includes the \\ninstallation of a catalytic oxygen removal system and a pipeline to connect the mine\\u2019s gas \\nCOAL MINING \\nII-10 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nprocessing system to a natural gas pipeline. Pipeline costs estimated for this analysis are adjusted \\nbased on mine proximity to commercial pipeline but do not attempt to account for variations in \\nterrain across countries. \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual O&M Costs: The annual costs include costs of recovery system and cost of gas treatment \\nand compression required for injection into commercial natural gas pipelines. \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual Benefits: Revenues from this option are the gas sales based on the volume of gas \\nproduced and the market price of natural gas. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Effectiveness: The analysis assumes a technical effectiveness of 21%. As shown in \\nTable 1-4, this considers a recovery efficiency of 75% (reflects the loss of 25% of the gas cannot be \\nused in pipeline injection because the methane concentration is too low to process to pipeline \\nspecifications) and destruction efficiency of 75% to account for losses during transport to point of \\nsale and injection into a commercial natural gas pipeline. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Lifetime: 15 years \\nDegasification for Electricity Generation \\nDrained methane can be used to fire internal combustion (IC) engines that drive generators to make \\nelectricity for sale to the local power grid (USEPA, 2011b). The quality of methane required for use in \\npower generation can be less than that required for pipeline injection. Internal combustion (IC) engine \\ngenerators can generate electricity using gas that has heat content as low as 300 Btu/cf or about 30% \\nmethane. Mines can use electricity generated from recovered methane to meet their own on-site \\nelectricity requirements and can also sell electricity generated in excess of on-site needs to utilities \\n(USEPA, 2008b). \\nCoal mining is a very energy-intensive industry that could realize significant cost savings by \\ngenerating its own power. Nearly all equipment used in underground mining runs on electricity, \\nincluding mining machines, conveyor belts, ventilation fans, and elevators. While most of the equipment \\nused in mining operations is used 250 days a year for two shifts per day, ventilation systems are required \\nto run continuously year round. These systems require large amounts of energy, up to 60% of a mine\\u2019s \\ntotal electricity usage. Total electricity demand can exceed 24 kWh per ton of coal produced (USEPA, \\n2008b). \\n\\u2022 \\nCapital Cost: The cost for this option includes the cost of gas processing to remove gas \\ncontaminants (primarily water vapor and solid particles), the electricity generation equipment, \\nand power grid connection equipment. Costs are assumed to be $1,300/kW. Assuming a 2 MW \\nfacility and a capacity factor of 90%, total installed capital costs of electricity generation would be \\n$2.7 million. Total installed capital costs for this abatement measure would be $4.5 million, which \\nincludes the $850,000 for recovery, assuming 20% owner\\u2019s costs and 5% contingencies. \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual O&M Costs: The annual costs include $0.02/kWh for the engine-gen set in addition to \\nthe $2.2/Mcf cost of the recovery system. Assuming a 600 Mcf/d flow and 90% capacity total \\nO&M costs would be approximately $0.8 million USD. \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual Benefits: Revenues in the form of power sales at market electricity prices. A 2 MW \\ncapacity generation facility with a 90% capacity factor would be expected to generate \\n COAL MINING \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nII-11 \\napproximately 16,000 MWh of electricity. Assuming an energy price of $0.075/kWh7, this project \\nwould generate $1.2 million in revenue from electricity sales. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Effectiveness: The analysis assumes a technical effectiveness of 28%, assuming a \\nrecovery efficiency of 75% and destruction efficiency of 98% in the energy generation unit. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Lifetime: 15 years \\nII.1.3.3 \\nDegasification for On-site Utilization\\u2014Process Heat \\nThis category of abatement measures includes (1) recovery for use in the boiler for supporting in-\\nmine heating and (2) recovery for coal drying. \\nMine Boilers \\nDrained methane can be used to fuel on-site boilers that provide space or water heat to mine facilities. \\nThis analysis assumes that existing boilers will be retrofitted to burn methane and that the drained \\nmethane is of sufficient quality to fuel the mine\\u2019s boiler and no additional gas processing is required. \\n\\u2022 \\nCapital Cost: The costs for this option are primarily associated with the capital cost to retrofit the \\nmine boiler to fire drained gas. The analysis assumes a 8.1 MMBTU/hr8 average boiler heat load \\nand a retrofit cost of $7,500/MMBTU/hr. Assuming the mine boiler fuel demand was 10 Mcf/hr, \\ntotal installed capital costs for this abatement measure would be $635,000, which includes \\n$382,000 for the recovery system, $122,000 for boiler retrofit, and an additional 20% in owner\\u2019s \\ncosts and 5% for contingencies. \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual O&M Costs: The annual costs are the $2.4/Mcf to operate the recovery system. Assuming \\na 240 Mcf/d flow and 90% capacity, the total O&M costs would be approximately $213,000 USD. \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual Benefits: Benefits are the energy costs offset by using the drained methane gas as a \\nsubstitute fuel source (offsetting coal consumption). Revenues associated with this project will be \\nthe quantity of coal replaced at the mine mouth coal market price ($/MMBTU). \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Effectiveness: The analysis assumes a recovery efficiency of 75% and destruction \\nefficiency of 98% when combusted in mine boiler. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Lifetime: 15 years \\nCoal Drying \\nAnother on-site direct use application for drained CMM is to use it as a fuel in thermal coal drying \\noperations at coal preparation plants co-located near an underground mine. The existing coal drying \\nprocess can be retrofitted to burn methane as a supplemental fuel in addition to burning coal. Similar to \\nthe mine boiler option, we assumed the CMM will not require further processing to serve as fuel to the \\ndryer. \\n\\u2022 \\nCapital Cost: The cost of converting the dryer to burn CMM was assumed to be the same as the \\ncost of converting the boiler firing system [$7,500/MMBtu/hr]. The analysis assumed an average \\ncoal drying rate of 380 tons/hr (USEPA, 1998). Assuming the average coal dryer heating \\n7 The actual price utilities would be willing to pay will vary depending on market and regulatory environment \\nwithin the specific country.

Assuming a 240 Mcf/d flow and 90% capacity factor, total O&M costs would be \\napproximately $213,000 USD. \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual Benefits: Benefits are the energy costs offset by using the drained methane gas as a \\nsubstitute fuel source (offsetting coal consumption).

Flare systems considered include an open flare and \\nenclosed combustion system, which consists of a mounted burner where the flame is exposed (open) or \\nthe flame is enclosed in a stack. The costs of the flaring system consist of firing equipment and \\nmonitoring and metering equipment to validate methane destruction levels. \\n\\u2022 \\nCapital Cost: The cost of installing a flare system to burn CMM was assumed to be $280/Mcf/day. \\nAssuming an average daily flow rate of 600 Mcf gas, the total installed capital costs for this \\nabatement measure would be $1,239,000, which includes $850,000 for the recovery system, \\n$134,000 for the flare system, and an additional 20% in owner\\u2019s costs and 5% for contingencies. \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual O&M Costs: The annual costs to operate the recovery system are assumed to be \\n$2.4/Mcf. Assuming a 600 Mcf/d flow and 90% capacity factor, total O&M costs would be \\napproximately $489,000 USD. \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual Benefits: There are no revenues associated with this option. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Effectiveness: The analysis uses a technical effectiveness of 28%, which assumes a \\nrecovery efficiency of 75% and destruction efficiency of 98% when combusted in flaring system. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Lifetime: 15 years \\nII.1.3.5 \\nVAM Oxidation \\nOxidation technologies (both thermal and catalytic) have the potential to use CH4 emitted from coal \\nmine ventilation air. Extremely low CH4 concentration levels (typically below 1%) make it economically \\ninfeasible to sell this gas to a pipeline. However, thermal oxidizers can combust the VAM converting it to \\nH2O and CO2. VAM oxidation is technically feasible at CH4 concentrations between 0.25% and 1.25%. For \\nmines with lower VAM concentrations, a supplemental gas is required to bring the concentration above \\nthe 0.25% concentration limit. \\n9 MMBTU/hr = Million British Thermal Units per hour \\n COAL MINING \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nII-13 \\n\\u2022 \\nCapital Cost: Abatement measure costs include the ductwork required to collect VAM exhaust \\nfrom the mine\\u2019s ventilation system at the surface vents, the design and installation of a thermal \\noxidizer unit, and any supporting auxiliary equipment. The total installed capital cost of the \\nVAM oxidizer unit is $23 per unit of recoverable ventilation air flow measured in cubic feet per \\nminute [cfm]. Assuming the recoverable ventilation air flow rate of 100 Mcfm and a CH4 \\nconcentration of 0.2%, capital costs would be $2.3 million USD (=100,000 cfm X $23/cfm). The total \\ninstalled capital costs for this abatement measure would be approximately $2.8 million after \\nassuming allowances of 20% in owner\\u2019s costs and 5% for contingencies. \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual O&M Costs: Annual operating costs include costs to maintain the oxidizer unit, the \\nelectricity required to operate the oxidizer blowers (0.075 kWh/mcf), and the periodic relocation \\ncosts of moving equipment to the new location of a mine ventilation shaft (every 5 years at a cost \\nof $4/cfm). Assuming a 100 Mcfm flow rate, total O&M costs would be approximately $462,000 \\nUSD, where VAM blower electricity costs account for 55% of the annual costs, while oxidizer \\nO&M costs represent 28%, and annualized relocation costs make up the balance. \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual Benefits: Although low-grade heat can be captured from the VAM oxidizer, little \\neconomic benefit can be obtained from it and only under special site-specific conditions; for this \\nreason, we assume there are no energy-related benefits for this abatement measure. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Effectiveness: The analysis assumes a technical effectiveness of between 19% and 68%, \\nwhich assumes a recovery efficiency of 25% (in 2010) to 90% (in 2030) and destruction efficiency \\nof 98% in a VAM oxidation unit. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Lifetime: 15 years \\nII.1.3.6 \\nEvaluation of Future Mitigation Option and Trends \\nBased on our review of existing abatement measures, technology improvements have the potential to \\nreduce the costs of VAM oxidation technology. Despite its abatement potential, VAM oxidation is the \\nmeasure with the highest abatement costs largely due to three key factors that include: (1) the equipment \\nitself is large and costly; (2) the lack of a revenue source; and (3) only a handful of technologies have been \\ndemonstrated at a commercial scale and as such economies of scale in production have not been realized. \\nThe development of an international carbon market like the United Nations Framework Convention on \\nClimate Change\\u2019s (UNFCCC\\u2019s) Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) or the European Trading System \\n(ETS) would provide a source of revenue from the sale of carbon reduction credits. In addition, \\nimprovements in design and catalysts have the potential to reduce the cost of oxidation over time. All \\nother abatement measures described in this chapter are assumed to be mature technologies. \\nII.1.4 \\nMarginal Abatement Costs Analysis \\nThis section describes the methodological approach to the international assessment of CMM \\nabatement measures. Here we describe the modeling approach applied to the sector and highlight the \\nunique facets of the modeling approach that are required to align with the general modeling framework \\ndescribed in the technical summary of this report. \\nII.1.4.1 \\nMethodological Approach \\nThe analysis seeks to characterize the cost of abatement in the coal mining sector by developing \\nproject cost estimates for a series of representative mines that represent the population of active \\nunderground coal mines in a reference location, which is the United States. Abatement measures are \\napplied to the technically applicable stream of emissions (degasification, or ventilation air streams). The \\nCOAL MINING \\nII-14 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nMAC model calculates break-even prices for each representative coal mine based on the facility \\ncharacteristics that include annual methane liberation, presence of existing degasification operations, \\nmine ventilation air flow rate, and VAM concentration. Figure 1-3 illustrates the flow of emissions and \\nthe country and technology factors that determine the abatement potential. \\nFigure 1-3: \\nFlow Chart of the Coal Mining Sector MAC Modeling Approach \\nThe MAC model internationalizes the abatement measures\\u2019 project costs by applying country-specific \\nfactors to adjust individual components of the technology costs and expected benefits (i.e., capital, labor, \\nenergy and materials) to transpose costs from a United States context to the international country of \\ninterest. The MAC model then applies the general break-even cost calculation using the internationalized \\ncosts and benefits to develop country-specific abatement cost estimates. \\nII.1.4.2 \\nAssessment of Sectoral Trends \\nAbatement potential estimated in this report is limited to the subset of emissions from underground \\ncoal mining activities. No abatement measures are considered for surface mining, abandoned mines, or \\npost-mining operations. The analysis assumed that the majority of emissions from the coal mining sector \\ncome from underground coal mining activity. As a result, a significant proportion of the BAU emissions \\nprojected (see Table 1-3 above) are available for abatement via the measures discussed in this chapter. \\nThis analysis considers country-specific data when available to adjust the basic assumption that between \\n70% and 98% of emissions are available for abatement (i.e., the quantity of emissions from underground \\nmining activities). For countries for which no other information was available, expert judgment was used \\nto assess the quantity of emissions eligible for abatement. \\n COAL MINING \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nII-15 \\nII.1.4.3 \\nDefinition of Model Facilities for the Analysis \\nA population of representative underground coal mines was developed using publicly available data \\nfor the U.S. active underground coal mines. The dataset included detailed information on over 100 active \\nmines with average methane liberation rates greater than 0.1 million cubic feet per day. Information was \\nalso available on the methane concentration in mine ventilation air. \\nThe international population of facilities is defined through a representative dataset of underground \\nmines with the accompanying mine-specific characterizations. This includes the gassiness of the mine and \\nthe concentration of methane present in the mine\\u2019s ventilation air. \\nII.1.4.4 \\nEstimating Abatement Project Costs and Benefits \\nMine characteristics for each mine in the facility database were used to estimate abatement project \\ncosts and benefits. Applying the costs described in Section II.1.3, the CMOP project Cash Flow Model \\nprovided outputs including initial capital investment, annual recurring costs for operation and \\nmaintenance, and the quantity of energy saved or offset. The costs and benefits data are then used as \\ninputs in the MAC model. The cost functions used in the CMOP model are assumed to be representative \\nof typical projects in the United States. Please refer to the CMOP model documentation for additional \\ndetails on how costs are calculated. \\nTable 1-5 provides an example of how the break-even prices are calculated for each abatement \\nmeasure. Project costs and benefits calculated for each coal mine are used in the calculation that solve for \\nthe break-even price that sets the project\\u2019s benefits equal to its costs. \\nThe break-even prices presented in Table 1-5 represent weighted average break-even prices weighted \\nby total annual methane liberated across the population of coal mines used for this analysis. Each coal \\nmine will have its own break-even price based on the amount of methane recovered. Break-even prices \\nwill be higher for less gassy coal mines and lower (potentially negative) for most gassy mines. Complete \\ninternational MAC results are presented in Section II.1.4.5. \\nTable 1-5: \\nExample Break-Even Price Calculation for Coal Mine Abatement Measures \\nAbatement Option \\nReduced \\nEmissions \\n(tCO2e) \\nAnnualized \\nCapital \\nCostsb \\n($/tCO2e) \\nNet Annual \\nCosta \\n($/tCO2e) \\nTax Benefit of \\nDepreciation \\n($/tCO2e) \\nBreak-Even \\nPriceb \\n($/tCO2e) \\nEnergy End Uses \\nPipeline Injection \\n99,629 \\n$18.5 \\n\\u2212$19.5 \\n$3.76 \\n\\u2212$4.69 \\nElectricity Generation \\n130,338  \\n$38.7 \\n\\u2212$33.0 \\n$7.84 \\n\\u2212$2.18 \\nOn-Site Direct Use \\n249,175  \\n$2.5 \\n\\u2212$2.8 \\n$0.50 \\n\\u2212$0.85 \\nExcess Gas Flaring \\nEnclosed Flare System \\n298,333  \\n$1.7 \\n$5.0 \\n$0.35 \\n$6.33 \\nCombustion of VAM \\nVAM Oxidation \\n46,430 \\n$37.5 \\n$28.0 \\n$7.61 \\n$57.91 \\na Assumes tax rate = 40%; discount rate = 10%, technical lifetime = 15 years \\nb AEO 2010 Energy prices; dry natural gas ($/Mcf); electricity $/kWh); and coal ($/ton) \\nCOAL MINING \\nII-16 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nII.1.4.5 \\nMAC Analysis Results \\nGlobal abatement potential in 2020 and 2030 is 400 and 468 MtCO2e, respectively.

Successfully \\naddressing these issues would improve development of the MACs and predictions of their behavior as a \\nfunction of time. Some of these limitations include the following. \\n\\u2022 \\nAccurate Distribution of Mine Type for Each Country. Extrapolating from available information \\nabout individual mines to project fugitive emissions at a national level implies that the available \\ndata are representative of the country\\u2019s coal production not already included in the existing \\ndatabase. A more accurate distribution of representative mines would improve the accuracy of \\nthe cost estimates and the shape of each MAC. These data would include mines of all sizes, \\nemissions factors, and production levels. This lack of information becomes increasingly \\nproblematic when evaluating a country such as China, where the majority of mines are small and \\nprivate mines are not represented in currently available data sources. \\n\\u2022 \\nCountry-Specific Tax and Discount Rates. In this analysis, a single tax rate was applied to mines \\nin all countries to calculate the annual benefits of each technology. Similarly, the discount rate \\nmay vary by country.

Globally, production and consumption of natural gas are expected to increase in both the near \\nterm and long term. Between 2008 and 2035, natural gas supplies are expected to increase by almost 60 \\ntrillion cubic feet, or roughly 1.6% per year (EIA [U.S. Energy Information Administration], 2011a). The \\nmajority of production growth is projected to occur in non-Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \\nDevelopment (OECD) countries most notably, in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa regions, where \\nproduction growth rates average 2.8, 2.5, and 2.4% per year, respectively. Figure 2-4 presents projected \\nglobal gas production by major region from 2008 to 2035. Growth in natural gas production from non-\\nOECD countries between 2015 and 2035 is projected to be twice the growth in production from OECD \\ncountries. Expanded production in non-OECD countries is expected to exceed regional demand allowing \\nfor net exports to OECD countries. \\nFigure 2-4: \\nGlobal Natural Gas Production: 2015\\u20132035 \\n \\nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). (2011a). International Energy Outlook 2011. Table G1. World total natural gas \\nproduction by region, Reference case, 2008\\u20132035. \\nAnother trend in the international gas market is the increased production of unconventional gas \\nresources (i.e., tight gas, shale gas, and coalbed methane). Preliminary international estimates suggest \\nthat the quantity of \\u201ctechnically recoverable shale gas resources\\u201d is equal to all existing proven natural \\ngas reserves worldwide (EIA, 2011b). Although the unconventional gas resources have not been fully \\nassessed, energy experts are projecting significant increases in production over 2035 time horizon. The \\nmost notable increases are expected in the United States, Canada, and China, where unconventional gas \\nis expected to account for 47, 51, and 72% of domestic production, respectively, in 2035 (EIA, 2011a). \\nTechnology advancements in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have enabled the United States \\nto tap into its vast unconventional gas resources.

Key factors that contributed to the growth in emissions include expansions in ONG \\nproduction and increases in natural gas consumption. \\nProjected Emissions Estimates \\nWorldwide CH4 emissions from ONG systems are projected to increase by 26% between 2010 and \\n2030 (an average annual rate of 1.2%), slightly lower than in early years (1990\\u20132010).

The abatement measures, such as inspection and maintenance programs for leaks or \\nequipment retrofits or modifications, may be applied to ONG processes and equipment, including \\ncompressors/engines, dehydrators, pneumatics/controls, pipelines, storage tanks, and wells. \\nAbatement measures available to mitigate CH4 losses from activities associated with or directly from \\nthe operation of equipment components common across the ONG system segments of production, \\nprocessing, transmission, and distribution. These abatement options in the ONG system segments \\ngenerally fall into three categories: equipment modifications/upgrades; changes in operational and \\nmaintenance practices including DI&M; and installation of new equipment.  ONG industry-related \\nvoluntary programs such as the Global Methane Initiative (GMI) and USEPA\\u2019s Natural Gas STAR \\nProgram, which are aimed at identifying cost-effective CH4 emission reduction opportunities, have \\ndeveloped a well-documented catalog of potential CH4 abatement measures that are applicable across the \\nsegments of the ONG system. Abatement measures documented by the USEPA\\u2019s Natural Gas STAR \\nProgram serve as the basis for estimating the costs of abatement measures used in this analysis. It is \\nimportant to note that although abatement measures identified by the Natural Gas STAR Program are \\ncited as cost-effective based on Industry Partner-reported experiences, the abatement measure\\u2019s cost-\\neffectiveness is determined by the component\\u2019s emissions rate and the value of energy recovered. This \\nanalysis uses average emission factors when estimating the break-even prices for each measure. In many \\ncases, these average emission rates are lower than the case study examples cited in the Natural Gas STAR \\nProgram\\u2019s documentation. As a result, abatement measures cited as cost-effective by the Natural Gas \\nSTAR Program\\u2019s Partners may not necessarily be the lowest cost options in the MAC analysis. \\nThis section discusses the abatement measures considered for this analysis and presents the costs, \\nbenefits, technical applicability, reductions efficiency, and the expected technology lifetime of each \\nmeasure. The abatement measures presented in Tables 2.3 through 2.6 provide an overview of the options \\nconsidered in each segment of the oil and gas sector.  A more complete list of the abatement measures \\nincluded in the Oil and Gas Sector MAC model is provided as Appendix D to this chapter. \\nII.2.3.1 \\nOil and Natural Gas Production \\nThe production segment of the ONG system consists of wells, compressors, dehydrators, pneumatic \\ndevices, chemical injection pumps, heaters, meters, pipeline, liquid storage tanks, and central \\ngathering/storage facilities. Table 2-3 presents the list of abatement measures applied to the production \\nsegment of ONG systems. In addition, this section characterizes two important abatement measures \\nconsidered in the production segment: reduced emissions from hydraulically fractured gas well \\ncompletions and installation of vapor recovery units (VRUs) on crude oil storage tanks. \\nReduced Emissions for Hydraulically Fractured Natural Gas Well Completions \\nReduced emissions completion (REC) is a method designed to capture 90% of the gas that would \\notherwise be flared or vented during new well construction and workovers on existing wells that are \\nhydraulically fractured. Equipment includes a sand trap, separator, and a gathering line to route gas to \\nsales pipelines or reserve tanks. Depending on the well field operations and frequency of well \\ncompletions, it may be more cost-effective to rent rather than purchase capital equipment (USEPA, \\n2011a). The use of RECs will result in increased sales of recovered gas.

In \\nthe United States, an average of 34 barrels of condensate are recovered during each completion or \\nrecompletion (USEPA, 2011b). Although the value of the recovered gas condensate would be \\ndetermined by the gas composition, based on an assumed price of $70 per barrel (bbl), the \\nrecovered gas condensate would contribute an additional $2,400 in revenues per completion or \\nrecompletion. \\n\\u2022 \\nApplicability: This technique applies to hydraulically fractured gas well completions and \\nworkovers. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Effectiveness: This analysis assumes a technical effectiveness is 54% which is the \\nproduct of the 90% reduction efficiency and a technical applicability of 60% and market \\npenetration of 100%. \\nOIL AND NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nII-29 \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical lifetime: 1 implementation event per year per hydraulically fractured well. \\nInstall Vapor Recovery Units (VRUs) \\nCrude oil and condensate storage tanks are widely used to stabilize the flow of oil or condensate \\nbetween wells and transportation sites. Inside these tanks, light hydrocarbons (often with a heavy \\nconcentration of methane) dissolved in the crude oil or condensate flash out of solution and collect \\nbetween the liquid and the roof of the tank. As liquid levels fluctuate, vapors are often vented into the \\natmosphere. VRUs can capture 95% of these light hydrocarbon vapor emissions (USEPA, 2006a). The \\nrecovered vapors can be sold or used on site as fuel. \\n\\u2022 \\nCapital costs: Capital costs range from $40,000 to $120,000 (equivalent to $50,000 to $140,000 in \\n2008 dollars), depending on the capacity of the unit (between 25 and 500 Mcf per day), sales line \\npressure, number of tanks, size and type of compressor, and the degree of automation. \\nInstallation costs range from 50 to 100% of the capital equipment cost and vary depending on the \\nlocation of the tanks and the size of the VRU required. \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual costs: Incremental annual O&M costs are about 15% of initial cost. The annual costs are \\ndetermined by the capacity of the VRU, as well as the location (weather), electricity costs, and the \\ntype of oil produced. \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual benefits: VRUs can reduce the hydrocarbon vapor emissions of hydrocarbon liquid \\nstorage tanks by about 95%. The vapors that are recovered can be used in several different ways. \\nThey can be used on site as fuel (where their value is equal to the price of the fuel they displaced). \\nAlternatively, the vapors can be piped to a natural gas gathering pipeline or to a processing plant \\nthat separates the natural gas liquids and the methane and sells them separately. Because the \\nrecovered vapors generally have a higher Btu content than pipeline quality natural gas, the \\nvapors are more valuable and sell for a higher price on an energy content basis. \\n\\u2022 \\nApplicability: Applied to crude oil and condensate storage tanks \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Effectiveness: The technical effectiveness of this option is 58% based on a reduction \\nefficiency of 95%, technical applicability of 61%, and a market penetration of 100%. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Lifetime: 15 years \\nFor detailed discussion of other options available to the ONG production segments, we refer the \\nreader to USEPA\\u2019s Natural Gas STAR Program website. \\nII.2.3.2 \\nGas Processing and Transmission Segments \\nThe processing segment of the natural gas system consists of gas plant facilities that incorporate the \\nuse of vessels, dehydrators, compressors, acid gas removal (AGR) units, heaters, and pneumatic devices. \\nThe transmission segment consists of transmission pipeline networks, compressor stations, and meter \\nand pressure-regulating stations. Table 2-4 and Table 2-5 present the list of abatement measures applied \\nto the gas processing and gas transmissions segment of a natural gas system. Similar to the previous \\nsection, this section briefly characterizes four important abatement measures considered in the gas \\nprocessing and transmission segment. \\nDirected Inspection & Maintenance (DI&M) on Processing Plants and Booster Stations \\nDI&M is a cost-effective approach to reduce methane emissions from leaking components throughout \\nthe oil and natural gas industry including at natural gas processing plants. The activities include a four-\\npart process that identifies, prioritizes, and implements the most cost-effective emissions reductions. Step \\n1 of the process is to identify and measure the leaks using leak detection and measurement techniques.  \\nOIL AND NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS \\nII-30 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nTable 2-4: \\nAbatement Measures for the Natural Gas Processing Segment \\nAbatement Measure \\nComponent \\nTotal \\nInstalled \\nCapital Cost \\n($2008) \\nAnnual \\nO&M \\n($2008) \\nTime \\nHorizon \\nTechnical \\nEffectivenessa \\nInstalling Surge Vessels for Capturing \\nBlowdown Vents  \\nBlowdowns/Venting \\n158,940 \\n28,078 \\n15 \\n50% \\nDirected Inspection & Maintenance \\nat Processing Plants and Booster \\nStations - Compressors \\nCentrifugal \\nCompressors (dry \\nseals) \\n\\u2014 \\n15,581 \\n1 \\n12% \\nDirected Inspection & Maintenance \\nat Processing Plants and Booster \\nStations - Compressors \\nCentrifugal \\nCompressors (wet \\nseals) \\n\\u2014 \\n6,131 \\n1 \\n12% \\nReplacing Wet Seals with Dry Seals \\nin Centrifugal Compressors \\nCentrifugal \\nCompressors (wet \\nseals) \\n380,804 \\n(102,803) \\n5 \\n66% \\nInstalling Catalytic Converters on \\nGas Fueled Engines and Turbines \\nGas Engines  - \\nExhaust Vented \\n7,924 \\n4,374 \\n10 \\n56% \\nReplace Gas-Assisted Glycol Pumps \\nwith Electric Pumps \\nKimray Pumps \\n2,788 \\n1,949 \\n10 \\n100% \\nDirected Inspection & Maintenance \\nat Processing Plants and Booster \\nStations \\nPlants \\n\\u2014 \\n10,134 \\n5 \\n95% \\nDirected Inspection & Maintenance \\nat Processing Plants and Booster \\nStations - Compressors \\nRecip.

Although the initial expense of the survey can be relatively high, \\nit was found that the costs can be recovered in the first year through reductions in gas leakage. USEPA \\n(2003a) documentation suggests the initial baseline survey cost is typically between $1 and $2 per \\ncomponent on average. Depending on their size, typical processing facilities may have between 14,000 \\nand 55,000 components. Subsequent follow-up surveys are found to cost significantly less compared with \\nthe initial survey, because they are more targeted to the components that are most likely to leak and the \\nmost beneficial to repair. \\nOIL AND NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nII-31 \\nTable 2-5: \\nAbatement Measures for the Natural Gas Transmission Segment \\nAbatement Measure \\nComponent \\nTotal \\nInstalled \\nCapital Cost \\n($2008) \\nAnnual \\nO&M \\n($2008) \\nTime \\nHorizon \\nTechnical \\nEffectivenessa \\nDirected Inspection and Maintenance \\nat Compressor Stations - \\nCompressors \\nCentrifugal \\nCompressors (dry \\nseals) \\n\\u2014 \\n15,581 \\n1 \\n13% to 14% \\nReplacing Wet Seals with Dry Seals in \\nCentrifugal Compressors \\nCentrifugal \\nCompressors (wet \\nseals) \\n380,804 \\n(102,803) \\n5 \\n71% to 77% \\nInstall Flash Tank Separators on \\ndehydrators \\nDehydrator Vents \\n9,504 \\n\\u2014 \\n5 \\n67% \\nOptimize glycol circulation rates in \\ndehydrators \\nDehydrator vents \\n\\u2014 \\n15 \\n1 \\n67% \\nInstalling Catalytic Converters on Gas \\nFueled Engines and Turbines \\nEngine/Turbine Exhaust \\nVented \\n7,924 \\n4,374 \\n10 \\n56% \\nDirected Inspection and Maintenance \\nat Gate Stations and Surface Facilities \\nM&R (Trans.

This analysis \\nassumes a $1 to $2 cost per component for leak detection and repair.  The analysis assumes an \\naverage processing plant has approximately 14,000 components.    \\n\\u2022 \\nBenefits: Gas savings from emission reductions. \\n\\u2022 \\nApplicability: Applicable to gas processing, gas gathering and booster stations, gas storage wells, \\ngate stations and surface facilities, and transmission compressor stations. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Effectiveness: This analysis assumes a technical effectiveness of 95% based on a 95% \\nreduction efficiency, a 100% technical applicability factor, and a 100% market penetration factor. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Lifetime: This analysis assumes a 1 year technical lifetime.   \\nIdentify and Replace or Retrofit High-Bleed Pneumatic Devices \\nPneumatic devices are widely used as controllers and monitors in the production sector, pressure \\nregulators and valve controllers in the processing sector, and actuators and regulators in the transmission \\nsector of the natural gas industry. When driven by natural gas, pneumatic devices release or bleed natural \\ngas into the atmosphere and thus are a leading source of methane emissions in the natural gas industry. \\nReplacing high-bleed devices with low-bleed devices and installing low-bleed retrofit kits on operating \\ndevices can reduce emissions by between 50 and 90% (USEPA, 2006b). \\n\\u2022 \\nCapital costs: Capital costs are the main component of replacement and retrofitting and vary \\ngreatly among the options. Multiple options can be employed at once to reduce gas bleed. Some \\ntypical options include replacing high-bleed level and pressure controllers with low-bleed \\ncontrollers, reducing supply pressure, and repairing leaks. This analysis assumes the capital cost \\nto be $165, which represents the incremental cost between a high bleed device and a low bleed \\ndevice (USEPA, 2011b).   \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual costs: Some improved maintenance costs are recurring. Maintenance costs are small \\nrelative to the cost of equipment. Replacing and retrofitting devices can potentially reduce annual \\nmaintenance costs. For this analysis the incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) cost is \\nassumed to be $0. \\n\\u2022 \\nBenefits: Revenue from gas savings of reduced methane leakage. Reductions in methane \\nemissions range from 45 to 260 Mcf per device annually depending on the device and application. \\n\\u2022 \\nApplicability: Applicable for high to moderate bleed pneumatic devices in the gas transmission \\nsegments. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Effectiveness: Technical effectiveness for this option ranges between 8% and 16% \\ndepending on the gas bleed rate. This analysis assumes a reduction efficiency of 9% (low bleed), \\n23% (medium bleed) and 25% (high bleed).  The technical applicability of 50%, 75%, and 90% for \\nlow-, medium-, and high-bleed devices, respectively.  Market penetration rate is assumed to be \\n100% for all devices. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Lifetime: 10 years \\nReducing Methane Emissions from Compressor Rod Packing Systems \\nIn natural gas compressors, the packing systems are used to maintain a tight seal around the piston \\nrod, preventing unwanted gas leakage while allowing the rod to move freely (USEPA, 2006). Leak rates \\ndepend on the fit, alignment of the packing parts, and wear. New packing systems installed on smooth, \\nOIL AND NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nII-33 \\nwell-aligned compressor rods can be expected to leak as little as 11.5 scfh. Leak rates increase as the \\nsystem ages because of wear on the packing rings and piston rod. Regularly monitoring and replacing \\nthese systems can result in cost savings and emissions reductions. This abatement measure is applied to \\ncompressors in the gas processing and transmission segments of the natural gas system. Packing systems \\ncomprise flexible rings that are secured around the compressor shaft. Packing cups hold the rings in \\nplace, and a nose gasket reduces leaks around the packing cups. Conventional packing rings have a life \\nexpectancy of about 3 to 5 years, but when the packing breaks down, leaks tend to increase so \\ndramatically that it may be desirable to replace packing rings even more frequently. A new, well-\\nfunctioning system could leak as little as 11 standard cubic feet per hour (scfh), compared with worn \\ncompressor rod packing systems that have leak rates as high as 900 scfh (USEPA, 2006c). \\n\\u2022 \\nCapital costs: Replacement compressor rod packing systems range from $7,800 per unit to \\nreplace the packing rings to over $41,000 for replacement of the piston rods and packing rings. \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual costs: There are no annual costs for these options. \\n\\u2022 \\nBenefits: Revenue from gas savings of reduced methane leakage. \\n\\u2022 \\nApplicability: Applies to reciprocating compressors located at processing plants and compressor \\nstations in the transmission segment \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Effectiveness: Technical effectiveness for this option is 1.5%, based on a reduction \\nefficiency of 10% a technical applicability of 15%, and a market penetration of 100%. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Lifetime: 5 years. \\nReplacing Wet Seals with Dry Seals in Centrifugal Compressors \\nCentrifugal compressors are used in the production, processing, and transmission of natural gas. The \\nseals located on the rotating shafts to reduce methane leakage have traditionally been \\u201cwet\\u201d (oil) seals. \\nReplacement of wet seals with dry seals leads to substantially reduced emissions and operating costs. The \\ndry seals are the only piece of capital equipment required and may be installed during a scheduled \\ndowntime. The lifetime of dry seals may be double that of wet seals, and they also emit significantly \\nlower emissions. It has been estimated that the wet seals may pay for themselves in as little as 11 months \\n(USEPA, 2006d). Other benefits include lower electricity requirements and maintenance costs and \\nincreased operating efficiency of the compressor and pipeline, which may also lead to higher gas sales. \\n\\u2022 \\nCapital costs: This analysis assumes a capital cost of $381,000 in 2008 dollars for wet seal \\nreplacement on a compressor with a shaft beam size of 6 inches. Cost of dry seals ($15,200 per \\nshaft inch) represents 48% of initial capital costs; equipment testing services (~0.5% of equipment \\ncost); engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services were assumed to be 100% of \\nequipment and testing costs.  \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual costs: O&M costs of dry seals are expected to be less than O&M costs for wet seals \\nbecause of reduced electricity requirements, increased operating efficiency of the compressor, \\nincreased reliability of the compressor, and potentially lower maintenance costs. Hence, \\nincremental recurring costs are assumed to equal a cost savings of just over $100,000 each year. \\nThese incremental cost savings are added to the annual benefits resulting from increased gas \\nsales. \\n\\u2022 \\nBenefits: Revenue from gas savings of reduced methane leakage.  Other annual cost savings due \\nto lower operation and maintenance costs are captured in the annual costs. \\n\\u2022 \\nApplicability: Applies to centrifugal compressors located at gas processing plants and \\ncompressor stations in the transmission segment. \\nOIL AND NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS \\nII-34 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Effectiveness: Technical effectiveness for this option is 66%.

Table 2-6 presents the list of abatement \\nmeasures applied to the distribution segment of a natural gas system.

Technical effectiveness is the product of three separate factors: the reduction efficiency, technical applicability, and \\nmarket penetration. \\nDI&M at Gate Stations and Surface Facilities \\nLeaking meters, pipes, valves, flanges, fittings, open-ended lines, and pneumatic controllers at gate \\nstations and surface facilities are a significant source of methane emissions. DI&M is a proven and cost-\\neffective way to detect, measure, prioritize, and repair equipment leaks to reduce methane emissions and \\nachieve gas savings (USEPA, 2003b). To implement DI&M, first, a baseline survey identifies and \\nquantifies leaks at gate stations and surface facilities. The results of this survey are then used to direct \\nrepairs toward the components that were identified as being most susceptible to leaking and the most \\nprofitable to repair. Then, the results of the initial survey are used to guide subsequent inspections and \\nmaintenance. \\n\\u2022 \\nCapital costs: There are no capital costs associated with this option. \\n\\u2022 \\nAnnual costs: The costs associated with starting a DI&M program are the cost of labor and \\nequipment for identifying leaking components and estimating the mass leak rate of those \\ncomponents; the labor cost for recording survey information; the labor cost of pinpointing \\nleaking components that are cost-effective to repair; the cost of parts, labor, and equipment \\ndowntime to fix the leaks; and the cost of labor for developing a plan that directs future \\ninspection and maintenance. Costs differ depending on the type of screening and measurement \\nequipment used and the characteristics of the staff who conduct the surveys and repairs. \\nMaintenance and repair are ongoing, so most costs are recurring. Annual costs vary depending \\non the frequency and comprehensiveness of the surveys and repairs. Over time, the scope and \\nfrequency of the surveys can be fine-tuned, as patterns emerge.  This analysis assumes an average \\nannual cost of $1,600 in 2008 dollars. \\nOIL AND NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nII-35 \\n\\u2022 \\nBenefits: Gas savings and methane emissions reductions vary widely depending on the number \\nof stations involved in the DI&M program and how long the program has been operating. \\n\\u2022 \\nApplicability: Applies to components inside gate stations and surface facilities. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Effectiveness 30% to 80%; higher efficiency for facilities handling higher volumes of \\nnatural gas.

Step 1 was to assess the sectoral trends, \\nwhich entailed reviewing recent international energy statistics for oil and gas. The second step was to \\ndevelop source-level emission estimates that could be used to build different model ONG systems. These \\nmodel systems reflect country-specific variations in production process techniques, level of maintenance, \\nand vintage of the existing infrastructure. Step 3 was to estimate country-specific abatement costs and \\nbenefits based on the relative cost factors for labor, energy, and non-energy inputs. Step three was to \\ncompute the break-even prices for each country-specific abatement measure. Finally, the MAC model \\ncomputes the abatement potential as a cumulative reduction for each measure assuming full (system-\\nwide) implementation. Sorting the break-even prices lowest to highest, the incremental reductions are \\ncumulated to construct the MAC curve presented in Section II.2.4.2. \\nAssessment of Sectoral Trends \\nThe objective in assessing the sectoral trends is to understand how emissions differ across countries \\nand how they vary over time. This not only considers aggregate growth or decline in emissions but also \\nany potential shift in sector emissions across the oil and gas segments. To this end, we reviewed the \\ncurrent international gas and oil industry activity data for 2010. Statistics reviewed included gross natural \\ngas production, oil production, LNG imports, and gas processing throughput (EIA, 2011; Oil & Gas \\nJournal, 2011). In the absence of real infrastructure data, these statistics provide insights on the relative \\nimportance of segments internationally. Table 2-7 presents these key statistics for the 10 largest emitting \\ncountries in 2010. \\nOIL AND NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS \\nII-36 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nTable 2-7: \\nInternational Statistics on Key Activity Drivers: 2010 \\nCountry \\n2010 Emissions \\n(MtCO2e) \\nDry Natural Gas \\nProductiona \\n(Bcf/year) \\nCrude Oil \\nProductionb \\n(Mbbl/day) \\nGas Processing \\nPlant \\nThroughputc \\n(MMcfd) \\nGas \\nTransmission \\nPipelinesd (km) \\nRussia \\n332.0 \\n22,965 \\n10,146 \\n926 \\n160,952 \\nUnited States \\n247.8 \\n26,858 \\n9,688 \\n45,808 \\n548,665 \\nKuwait \\n106.0 \\n422 \\n2,450 \\n1,034 \\n269 \\nIraq \\n94.1 \\n596 \\n2,408 \\n1,550 \\n3,365 \\nAngola \\n84.9 \\n364 \\n1,988 \\n137 \\n- \\nUzbekistan \\n84.7 \\n2,123 \\n105 \\nNA \\n10,253 \\nLibya \\n77.4 \\n1,069 \\n1,789 \\n2,567 \\n- \\nCanada \\n53.3 \\n6,695 \\n3,483 \\n29,154 \\n75,835 \\nIran \\n47.2 \\n7,774 \\n4,252 \\n10,509 \\n20,725 \\nVenezuela \\n30.2 \\n2,510 \\n2,375 \\n3,555 \\n5,347 \\na EIA.

Available at: http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=UZ \\nAlthough differences in annual production and throughput provide some indication of the size of a \\ncountry\\u2019s ONG system, considerations of age and the condition of the infrastructure are major factors in \\ndetermining the rate of source-level emissions and in turn the abatement potential associated with each \\nabatement measure. In general, countries with aging infrastructure will have \\u201cleakier\\u201d components and \\nin turn have a greater abatement potential. Conversely, countries with newly developed infrastructure \\nwill have less abatement potential. \\nAnother important trend to consider is the expansion of unconventional gas (shale gas) production. \\nThe growth in unconventional gas production (e.g., the United States, Canada, and China) is likely to \\nresult in an increased frequency of hydraulically fractured gas well completions and related workovers. \\nIn the absence of any regulatory or voluntary actions to reduce emissions from these sources, this trend \\nsuggests that the gas production segment will represent an even greater proportion of these nations\\u2019 \\nbaseline emissions over time. \\nDefining International Model Facilities for the Analysis \\nFor this analysis, we developed model ONG systems for each segment based initially on the USEPA \\nONG system emissions inventory. Scaling factors were developed based on country-specific activity \\nfactors developed from the international statistics illustrated in Table 2-6. Where reliable data were \\navailable, international adjustments were made to reflect specific country systems. For countries for \\nwhich data were not available, this analysis assumed the gas and oil system was similar to that in the \\nUnited States in terms of the distribution of emissions (total BAU emissions for each country is exogenous \\nto the MAC model obtained from USEPA, 2012a). The relative international factor was multiplied by the \\npercentage share of U.S. gas and oil CH4 emissions inventory at the segment/component source level \\n(e.g., compressors, valves, connections, pneumatic devices). The resulting \\u201cTechnical Applicability\\u201d (TA) \\nfactor is used to allocate a fraction of the national baseline emissions to each component source in the \\nONG inventory (e.g., wells, tanks, compressors, valves). \\nOIL AND NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nII-37 \\nMultiplying the TA factor by the baseline emissions yields the subset of emissions available for \\nreductions from each component source and abatement measure. The TA factor comprises two parts. The \\nU.S. 2010 GHG emissions inventory serves as the basis for the distribution of emissions across the \\nconstituent components (see USEPA, 2012b, Annex 3). The second component of the TA factor is the \\ncountry- and segment-specific relative activity factor (e.g., total oil production, gross natural gas \\nproduction). \\nRegulatory Considerations for the U.S. Natural Gas and Oil System \\nSpecial considerations were made for the United States to reflect the New Source Performance \\nStandards (NSPS) regulation that was in effect starting in year 2012. This regulation will affect the \\nproduction and processing segments of the ONG system by requiring the use of abatement measures \\nincluded in this analysis to control for volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from major new and \\nmodified emitting sources in the United States. This mitigation is no longer considered additional and \\nthus should be removed from the U.S. domestic MAC curve. For the purposes of this analysis, we have \\nremoved emissions sources covered under the NSPS regulation and any subsequent abatement potential \\nthat would have come from these sources. Figure 2-5 illustrates the key elements that led us to the \\nresulting distribution of emissions. \\nFigure 2-5: \\nDiagram of BAU Emissions for the United States Oil and Natural Gas System  \\n \\n \\nOIL AND NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS \\nII-38 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nTo capture the impact of the NSPS regulation for model years 2015 and beyond, we needed to \\nestimate the relative distribution of emissions that will be associated with controlled and uncontrolled \\nsources. We start with the 2010 U.S. inventory (USEPA, 2012), which is the basis of our analysis. Next, we \\nidentify all components in the inventory subject to the NSPS in the production and processing segments. \\nFor the NSPS controlled sources, we applied controls to these components using the reduction \\nefficiency (%) for each abatement measure from the MAC model to estimate the level of abatement \\nachieved by the NSPS rule. In Figure 2-5, controlled emissions equals the sum of reductions achieved \\nacross the NSPS sources. The residual emissions from NSPS sources are assumed to be included in the \\nprojected baselines (2015 to 2030). \\nFor the purposes of this analysis, we estimated residual emissions from controlled sources were 11% \\nof projected emissions, while emissions from uncontrolled sources were 89% of projected emissions. We \\napplied these shares to the baseline projections for years \\u2265 2015. \\nThis approach assumes a fixed distribution of emission over time in the MAC model. We recognize \\nthe limitations of this assumption and would ideally like to apply a trend to the shares for model years \\nbeyond 2015. Unfortunately, at the time of writing this report, data to develop this trend were not \\navailable. Any future work related to the U.S. MAC curve should consider developing a more dynamic \\ntrend that more accurately estimates the level of NSPS-controlled emissions and the subsequent \\ndistribution of emissions in the baseline projections over time. \\nBased on the analysis described here, the United States\\u2019 abatement potential presented in the MAC \\nmodeling results can be summarized in the following expression: \\n\\ud835\\udc34\\ud835\\udc4f\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5a\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc61 \\ud835\\udc43\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc59(\\ud835\\udc48\\ud835\\udc46\\ud835\\udc34) = \\u0dcd\\ud835\\udc48\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc50\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc5f\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc59\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc51 \\ud835\\udc38\\ud835\\udc5a\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc5c\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc56,\\ud835\\udc61\\u2217\\ud835\\udc47\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc50\\u210e\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc50\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc59 \\ud835\\udc38\\ud835\\udc53\\ud835\\udc53\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc50\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc63\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc5b\\ud835\\udc52\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc56,\\ud835\\udc57,\\ud835\\udc61 \\nwhere: \\nTechnical Effectivenessi,j,t = Reduction Efficiencyi,j,t * Tech Applicabilityi,j,t * Market Penetrationi,j,t \\ni = Uncontrolled emissions source \\nj = Abatement technology \\nt = Modeled year \\nEstimate Abatement Project Costs and Benefits \\nTurning to the abatement measures discussed in Section II.2.3, the analysis begins with technology \\ncosts for the United States as reported in the USEPA Lesson Learned documentation. We applied the \\nNelson-Farrar3 Oil Field and Refinery Operation cost indices to convert from reported-year costs to 2008 \\ndollars (USD) for capital and O&M costs, respectively. Next, we applied the country-specific relative \\nprice factors for labor, energy, and nonenergy components of annual costs and benefits. This final step \\nyielded country-specific costs and benefits used to compute the break-even price for each abatement \\nmeasure. Abatement measure costs and technical efficiencies were applied to estimate the break-even \\nprices. Table 2-7 presents the break-even prices for selected ONG system abatement measures for the \\nUnited States in 2010. For this analysis, we used the abatement measure costs, revenue, and reduction \\nefficiency as described in Section II.2.3 to estimate the break-even price for each abatement measure. A \\ncomplete list of ONG system abatement measures is presented in Appendix C. \\n                                                           \\n3 Nelson-Farrar Annual Cost Indices are available in the first issue of each quarter of the Oil and Gas Journal.  \\nOIL AND NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nII-39 \\nThe first step is to estimate the reduced emissions on a per unit basis for each technology. This value \\nis calculated by multiplying the abatement measure\\u2019s technical efficiency by the annual emissions per \\nunit of the component or process to which the abatement measure is being applied. The resulting annual \\nreduced emissions serve as the denominator in the break-even price calculation. \\nIn Table 2-8 we present abatement cost and revenues per metric ton of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) \\nreduced for the abatement measures with the largest national emissions reductions. Costs include the \\nannualized total installed capital cost and annual O&M costs. Offsetting these costs are the annual \\nrevenue in terms of gas savings and the tax benefit of depreciation. The break-even prices reported in \\nTable 2-8 are calculated by subtracting the annual revenues from the annualized costs. \\nTable 2-8: \\nExample Break-Even Price Calculation based on 2010 MAC for the United States \\nAbatement Measure \\nSystem \\nComponent/ \\nProcess \\nReduced \\nEmissions \\nper Unit \\n(tCO2e) \\nAnnualized \\nCapital \\nCosts \\n($/tCO2e) \\nAnnual \\nCost \\n($/tCO2e) \\nAnnual \\nRevenue \\n($/tCO2e) \\nTax Benefit \\nof \\nDepreciation \\n($/tCO2e) \\nBreak-\\nEven \\nPrice \\n($/tCO2e) \\nNational \\nIncremental \\nReductions \\n(MtCO2e) \\nProduction \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nConvert Gas Pneumatic \\nControls to Instrument Air \\nPneumatic Device \\nVents \\n71.0 \\n$335.68 \\n$441.41 \\n$10.01 \\n$82.50 \\n$684.58 \\n15.29 \\nReduced Emission \\nCompletions for Hydraulically \\nFractured Natural Gas Wells \\nUnconventional Gas \\nWell Completions \\n2,703.96 \\n$0.00 \\n$11.11 \\n$10.01 \\n$0.00 \\n$1.10 \\n8.82 \\nReplacing High-bleed \\nPneumatic Devices in the \\nNatural Gas Industry \\nPneumatic Device \\nVents \\n9.7 \\n$7.38 \\n$0.00 \\n$10.01 \\n$1.81 \\n\\u2212$4.44 \\n2.30 \\nProcessing \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nDirected Inspection & \\nMaintenance at Processing \\nPlants and Booster Stations \\nPlants \\n1,109.0 \\n$0.00 \\n$9.14 \\n$10.01 \\n$0.00 \\n\\u2212$0.87 \\n0.50 \\nFuel Gas Retrofit for BD \\nvalve - Take Recip. \\nCompressors Offline \\nRecip.

MAC curve results are presented in Table 2-9 \\nand Figure 2-6. Maximum abatement potential for ONG systems is 1,218 MtCO2e in 2030. For the year \\n2030, the results suggest that 842 MtCO2e or 40% of CH4 reductions in the ONG sector can be achieved at \\ncarbon prices less than or equal to $5/tCO2e. Furthermore over 35% of the 2030 emission reductions (747 \\nMtCO2e) are cost-effective at current energy prices (carbon prices \\u2264 $0/tCO2e). However, because natural \\ngas prices vary greatly by region, the break-even price and quantity of cost effective reductions varies by \\ncountry. \\nOIL AND NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nII-41 \\nTable 2-9: \\nAbatement Potential by Region at Selected Break-Even Prices in 2030 \\nCountry/Region \\nBreak-Even Price ($/tCO2e) \\n\\u201310 \\n\\u20135 \\n0 \\n5 \\n10 \\n15 \\n20 \\n30 \\n50 \\n100 \\n100+ \\nTop 5 Emitting Countries \\nIraq \\n69.2 \\n71.9 \\n73.9 \\n76.0 \\n80.3 \\n80.9 \\n80.9 \\n85.1 \\n85.2 \\n89.9 \\n110.0 \\nKuwait \\n37.3 \\n44.0 \\n46.7 \\n47.6 \\n47.7 \\n50.1 \\n50.7 \\n51.1 \\n55.2 \\n58.6 \\n73.5 \\nRussia \\n37.3 \\n37.3 \\n138.3 \\n185.7 \\n187.0 \\n189.6 \\n205.3 \\n205.8 \\n219.5 \\n232.8 \\n266.9 \\nUnited States \\n79.1 \\n81.0 \\n84.4 \\n93.3 \\n93.4 \\n98.5 \\n98.8 \\n99.2 \\n105.5 \\n109.7 \\n140.5 \\nUzbekistan \\n9.9 \\n9.9 \\n35.4 \\n47.6 \\n47.9 \\n48.5 \\n52.4 \\n52.6 \\n57.8 \\n59.6 \\n68.3 \\nRest of Region \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAfrica \\n116.3 \\n124.0 \\n124.1 \\n129.4 \\n135.8 \\n136.2 \\n141.4 \\n142.2 \\n145.0 \\n149.3 \\n178.8 \\nCentral and South \\nAmerica \\n31.8 \\n32.7 \\n32.8 \\n34.2 \\n36.2 \\n36.3 \\n37.4 \\n38.3 \\n38.4 \\n40.6 \\n49.4 \\nMiddle East \\n43.2 \\n51.6 \\n53.3 \\n55.3 \\n57.8 \\n58.5 \\n58.7 \\n60.7 \\n61.2 \\n63.6 \\n78.4 \\nEurope \\n15.0 \\n16.0 \\n16.3 \\n16.8 \\n17.2 \\n17.4 \\n18.0 \\n18.2 \\n18.8 \\n19.8 \\n26.1 \\nEurasia \\n22.9 \\n23.3 \\n42.6 \\n51.0 \\n52.3 \\n53.5 \\n56.9 \\n57.0 \\n61.6 \\n64.2 \\n76.7 \\nAsia \\n40.4 \\n55.8 \\n59.2 \\n62.7 \\n69.4 \\n71.0 \\n72.1 \\n73.6 \\n75.1 \\n76.7 \\n90.6 \\nNorth America \\n29.9 \\n32.0 \\n39.3 \\n42.7 \\n43.3 \\n44.4 \\n44.9 \\n45.2 \\n46.5 \\n47.7 \\n59.6 \\nWorld Total \\n532.2 \\n579.3 \\n746.5 \\n842.3 \\n868.1 \\n884.9 \\n917.5 \\n928.9 \\n969.8 1,012.4 1,218.6 \\n \\nFigure 2-6: \\nMarginal Abatement Cost Curves for Top 5 Emitters in 2030 \\n \\n-$30\\n-$20\\n-$10\\n$0\\n$10\\n$30\\n$40\\n$50\\n$60\\n0\\n50\\n100\\n150\\n200\\n250\\n$/tCO2e \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n$20\\nIraq\\nRussia\\nKuwait\\nUnited States\\nUzbekistan\\nOIL AND NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS \\nII-42 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nThe MAC illustrates the cumulative abatement achievable at incrementally higher carbon prices. At \\nextremely high break-even prices (> $500/tCO2e), the MAC becomes inelastic or unresponsive. The point \\nat which the MAC becomes unresponsive to any price change can also be considered the technical \\npotential associated with the suite of abatement measures considered. Thus, it can be inferred that \\nadditional reductions beyond approximately 58% of the projected baseline in 2030 would be unlikely \\nwithout additional policy incentives or technology improvements. \\nEconomies of scale have an impact on the cost-effectiveness of the abatement options. Hence, \\nabatement measures may have a lower break-even price when applied to facilities with higher CH4 \\nemission rates and higher break-even price at facilities with a lower emissions rate. \\nII.2.4.3 \\nUncertainties and Limitations \\nSeveral key areas of uncertainty constrain the accuracy of this analysis. Addressing these \\nuncertainties would improve the development of the MACs and predictions of their behavior as a \\nfunction of time. Two primary limitations are discussed below. \\nImproved information on the distribution of emissions in international baselines. This analysis \\nrelies on historical activity factors to adjust the distribution of U.S. baseline emissions to develop \\nprojections by country. Improvements to information on how gas and oil baselines are changing over \\ntime and across segments would improve the accuracy of abatement potential estimates. \\nComplete information on current abatement technologies used in the gas and oil industry \\ninternationally. Additional information on the current and planned implementation of abatement \\nmeasures internationally would improve the international estimates of abatement. \\n \\n \\nOIL AND NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nII-43 \\nReferences \\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

LFG is \\ngenerated over a period of several decades, with gas flows usually beginning 1 to 2 years after \\nthe waste is put in place. CH4 makes up approximately 50% of LFG. The remaining 50% is carbon dioxide \\n(CO2) mixed with small quantities of other gases, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The \\namount of CH4 generated by landfills per country is determined by a number of factors that include \\npopulation size, the quantity of waste disposed of per capita, composition of the waste disposed of, and \\nthe waste management practices applied at the landfill. Changes in these key factors drive projected \\ntrends in CH4 emissions. For a number of countries, LFG is one of the largest anthropogenic sources of \\nCH4 emissions. Despite efforts to control large landfill emissions, the landfill sector remains a significant \\nsource of CH4 emissions because of increasing waste streams in developed countries. In developing \\ncountries, the shift toward sanitary landfills and increased use of abatement measures is a key driver \\ntoward CH4 mitigation. \\nIn 2010, global CH4 emissions from landfills accounted for approximately 850 MtCO2e. Emissions \\nfrom landfills are moderately concentrated in several countries. Over 50% of emissions in 2010 come from \\njust ten countries. Figure 1-1 displays the business-as-usual (BAU) emissions for the landfill sector and \\nidentifies the top five emitting countries. Landfill emissions are projected to grow 13% between 2010 and \\n2030. In 2030, emissions from landfills represent 10% of the global total CH4 from all sources. \\nFigure 1-1: \\nEmissions Projections for the Landfill Sector: 2000\\u20132030 \\n0 \\n200 \\n400 \\n600 \\n800 \\n1,000 \\n1,200 \\nMtCO2 e \\n770 \\n847 \\n905 \\n2000 \\n2010 \\n2020 \\nYear \\n959 \\n2030 \\nMalaysia \\nRussia \\nChina \\nMexico \\nUnited States \\nROW \\nSource: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), 2012 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-1 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLANDFILLS \\nSeveral abatement measures are available to control landfill CH4 emissions and they are commonly \\ngrouped into three major categories: (1) collection and flaring, (2) LFG utilization systems (LFG capture \\nfor energy use), and (3) enhanced waste diversion practices (e.g., recycling and reuse programs). \\nAlthough flaring is currently the most common abatement measure, energy recovery options may be \\nmore cost-effective. Similarly, under favorable market conditions, recycling and reuse or composting \\nalternatives may provide additional means for reducing emissions from landfills. Note that options may \\nnot be mutually exclusive in that recycling can reduce the quantity of methane generated, which, in turn, \\nwill affect the economics of utilization systems. \\nGlobal abatement potential in the solid waste landfill sector is estimated to be approximately 589 \\nMtCO2e of total annual emissions in 2030, or 61% of the baseline emissions. The marginal abatement cost \\n(MAC) curve results are presented below in Figure 1-2. These curves suggest that there are significant \\nopportunities for CH4 reductions in the landfill sector at carbon prices below $20. Furthermore there are \\napproximately 70 to 80 MtCO2e of reductions that are cost-effective (no regret options) at current energy \\nprices. \\nFigure 1-2: \\nGlobal Abatement Potential in Landfill Sector: 2010, 2020, and 2030 \\n-$30 \\n-$20 \\n-$10 \\n$0 \\n$10 \\n$20 \\n$30 \\n$40 \\n$50 \\n$60 \\n0 \\n$/tCO2 e \\n50 \\n100 \\n150 \\n200 \\n250 \\n300 \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n350 \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\nThe following section briefly explains CH4 emissions from landfills.

In this section, we also describe historical and projected trends that influence baseline \\nemissions from municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. By volume, LFG is about half CH4 and half CO2. \\nTypically, LFG also contains small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen; less than 1% non-CH4 \\nvolatile organic compounds (NMVOCs); and trace amounts of inorganic compounds. The amount and \\nrate of CH4 generation depend on the quantity and composition of the landfilled material, as well as the \\nsite design and resulting physical conditions inside the fill. \\nOrganic waste is initially decomposed by aerobic bacteria after being landfilled. When the oxygen in \\nthe landfill cell (section of a landfill) is depleted, the remaining waste is broken down by anaerobic \\nbacteria through decomposition. Fermentation creates gases and short-chain organic compounds that \\nform the substrates, which provide for the growth of methanogenic bacteria, which in turn generates a \\nbiogas consisting of approximately 50% CO2 and 49% CH4, by volume. Measurable gas volumes are \\ngenerally available between 1 or 2 years after the waste is landfilled and continue to be generated for 10 \\nto 60 years. \\nThe amount and rate of CH4 production over time at a landfill depends on five key characteristics of \\nthe landfill material and surrounding environment: \\n\\u2022  \\nQuantity of Organic Material: The quantity of organic material, such as paper, food, and yard \\nwaste, is crucial to sustaining CH4-producing microorganisms. The CH4 production capacity of a \\nlandfill is directly proportional to its quantity of organic waste. CH4 generation increases as the \\nwaste disposal site continues to receive waste and then gradually declines after the site stops \\nreceiving waste. \\n\\u2022  \\nNutrients: CH4-generating bacteria need nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, sodium, and \\ncalcium for cell growth. These nutrients are derived primarily from the waste placed in the \\nlandfill. \\n\\u2022  \\nMoisture Content: The bacteria need water for cell growth and metabolic reactions to convert \\ncellulose to CH4. Landfills receive water from incoming waste, water produced by \\ndecomposition, surface water infiltration (precipitation), groundwater infiltration (in unlined \\nlandfills). In general, CH4 generation occurs at slower rates in arid climates than in nonarid \\nclimates. \\n\\u2022  \\nTemperature: Warm temperatures in a landfill speed the growth of CH4-producing bacteria. The \\ntemperature of waste in the landfill depends on landfill depth, the number of layers covering the \\nlandfill, and the regional climate. \\n\\u2022  \\npH: CH4 is produced in a neutral acidic environment (close to pH 7.0). The pH of most landfills is \\nbetween 6.8 and 7.2. Above pH 8.0, CH4 production is negligible. \\nThe methodology for estimating CH4 emissions from municipal solid waste landfills in this analysis is \\nbased on the first order decay model (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC], 2006). \\nThe key characteristics described above can vary considerably across the different types and features \\nof the waste disposal site, and this, in turn, influences landfill CH4 generation. This analysis considers \\nabatement measures\\u2019 impacts on three model facilities representing the solid waste management \\nalternatives with different levels of methane generating capacity. The following are the model facilities \\nconsidered: \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-3 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLANDFILLS \\nOpen dump sites: defined as solid waste disposal facilities where the waste is left uncompacted and \\nwithout cover. The waste in open dump sites is relatively shallow, therefore promoting aerobic \\nbiodegradation. This model facility is particularly relevant to developing countries where solid waste \\nmanagement practices are not well established. These facilities generate relatively small amounts of \\nmethane and for this, and safety reasons, have more limited applicability of mitigation technologies, \\nwhich are less effectiveness where applicable. \\nBasic landfills (also referred to as managed dump sites): defined as solid waste disposal facilities \\nwhere the waste is compacted and covered but do not have additional engineered systems. These \\nfacilities generate methane and in some cases can be modified to support an oxidation system and/or a \\ngas collection and flaring or energy recovery system. However, the collection efficiency 1 may not be as \\nefficient with a capture efficiency of approximately 75%. These facilities represent the baseline in most \\ndeveloping countries. \\nEngineered sanitary landfills: defined as facilities that include not only waste compaction and cover \\nbut they also are designed and constructed with gas and leachate collection systems. The higher degree of \\nengineering at these facilities generally allows for more efficient gas collection and control than basic \\nsanitary landfills. Engineered landfills typically have a collection efficiency of around 85%. These facilities \\nrepresent the majority of baseline emissions in major industrialized countries. \\nIII.1.2.1  \\nActivity Data or Important Sectoral or Regional Trends and Related\\nAssumptions \\nThis section discusses the historical and projected activity factor data that determine CH4 generation \\nat solid waste disposal sites and policies set to improve waste management practices. Historical and \\nprojected changes in population and household income are used as indicators of changes in the quantity \\nand type of consumption, which are directly linked to the quantity and type of waste generated by \\ncountries. \\nFor developing and emerging economies, the projected baseline emissions reflect assumptions about \\npopulation growth, economic growth, and changes in waste management practices over time in (USEPA, \\n2012). Continued growth in population along with increased household income and improvements in \\nwaste management practices will result in the growth of both waste generated and waste disposed of in \\nmanaged and engineered landfills. \\nFor developed countries with stable or declining growth in population and income, consumption is \\nassumed to result in only small increases in emissions over time. Developed countries are also assumed \\nto increasingly engage in waste diversion practices (e.g., recycling and composting) that divert \\nbiodegradable waste from landfills, ultimately changing the composition of landfilled waste and \\nlowering the annual methane generated over time. \\n1 Collection efficiency refers to the amount of methane generated in the landfill that is captured by the collection \\nsystem. In contrast, the reduction efficiency refers to the share of collected methane that is destroyed. For example \\nflare have a reduction efficiency of approximately 98%. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-4 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLANDFILLS \\nIII.1.2.2 \\nEmissions Estimates and Related Assumptions \\nThis section briefly discusses the historical and projected emission trends globally and presents the \\n2\\nbaseline emissions used in the MAC analysis. \\nHistorical Emissions Estimates \\nEmissions from landfills were estimated to have grown by 13% between 1990 and 2010. Key factors \\nthat contribute to the growth in landfill emissions include population growth, growth in personal income, \\nincreased industrialization, and improvements in waste management practices (USEPA, 2012). \\nProjected Emissions Estimates \\nWorldwide CH4 emissions from landfills are expected to increase at an average long run annual rate \\nof 0.6% (USEPA, 2012).

It is important to note the distinction between these two approaches to \\nemission reductions. Mitigation technologies represent add-on technologies that can be applied to one or \\nmore landfill types (i.e., open dump, basic landfill, engineered landfill) intended to capture and destroy \\nthe CH4 generated at the facility. Diverting organic waste from the landfill for alternative uses is the \\nsecond approach to reduce the quantity of LFG generated at existing landfills. As noted previously, these \\nmeasures are not mutually exclusive. By changing the composition of waste that is landfilled, diversion \\noptions lower the methane-generating potential of remaining waste that is landfilled. Diversion \\nalternatives are covered in this analysis but are distinguished from landfill-based mitigation technologies. \\nThis section discusses the abatement measures considered for this analysis.

Mitigation options considered for this analysis include collection of LFG for flaring, collection \\nfor electricity production, collection for direct use, and enhanced oxidation systems. \\nLFG Collection and Flaring \\nMost basic landfills and engineered landfills have (or are applicable for) LFG collection systems for \\nboth public health and facility safety concerns to prevent high concentrations of LFG in the fill. These \\nsystems prevent the migration of CH4 to on-site structures and adjacent property and prevent the release \\nof non-CH4 organic compounds (NMOCs) to the atmosphere. Wells and gathering lines may be \\nconstructed in advance or installed after waste has been landfilled. LFG collection usually begins after a \\nportion of a landfill is closed. Collection systems are configured either as vertical wells (which are most \\ncommon), horizontal trenches (which are primarily used for deeper landfills and landfill cells that are \\nactively being filled), or a combination of the two. Trenches or wellheads are connected to lateral piping \\nthat transports the LFG to a collection header. Typically there is a collection system monitor installed to \\nallow operators to adjust the gas flow (USEPA, 2010). \\nFlares ignite and burn LFG. Large landfills have historically collected CH4 and flared the gas. 3 Flare \\ndesigns include open and enclosed flares. Enclosed flares are more expensive but provide greater control \\nof combustion conditions, allow for stack testing, reduce light and noise nuisances, and might have \\nhigher combustion efficiencies (USEPA, 2010). \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Cost: Capital cost includes the construction of wells, wellheads, and laying of gathering \\nlines that make up the collection system, as well as the flare system with monitoring and control \\nsystems. Costs were derived from the USEPA Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) \\nProject Cost Estimation Model. The capital costs assume one well per acre installed at an average \\ninstallation cost of $150/ft. Installation of the wellheads and gathering lines is approximately \\n$17,000 per acre. Installed cost of the knockout blower and flare system is based on open flares \\nwith the maximum expected flow of LFG per minute ($963/maximum cubic feet per meter [cfm]). \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Cost: Typical annual O&M costs for collection \\nsystems are $2,250 per well and $4,500 per flare. Electricity costs to operate the blower for a 600 \\ncfm active gas collection system average $44,500 per year 4 (USEPA, 2010), assuming an electricity \\nprice of 7 cents/kWh and consumption rate of 0.002 kWh per ft3. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Benefits: No economic benefits (energy production) are associated with this option. \\n\\u2022  \\nApplicability: This option applies to all basic landfills and engineered landfills. \\n\\u2022  \\nTechnical Efficiency: This analysis assumes a collection efficiency of 75% for basic landfills and \\nof 85% for engineered landfills and a flaring efficiency of 98%. \\n\\u2022  \\nTechnical Lifetime: 15 years \\n3 Flares are typically a required component of energy recovery projects. In energy recovery projects, the flare system \\nis used to control LFG emissions during energy generation startups and downtime and may also be used to control \\nexcess gas production. \\n4 For this analysis we assume an electricity price of 7.5 cents/kWh and an energy consumption rate of 0.002 kWh/ft3. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-7 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLANDFILLS \\nLFG Collection for Electricity Generation \\nConverting LFG to electricity offers a potentially cost-effective way to use the gas being generated by \\nthe landfill. Often, revenue from the sale of energy produced can provide a cash flow that more than \\noffsets the implementation costs of this option. This option requires a LFG collection and flare system as \\ndescribed earlier in this section, as well as the electricity generation system. Components of the electricity \\ngeneration system include the equipment for generating energy (e.g., internal combustion engine, gas \\nturbine, or microturbine) and the interconnections for transmitting electricity produced to the energy \\ngrid. \\nLFG is extracted from landfills using a series of vertical or horizontal wells and a blower (or vacuum) \\nsystem. This system directs the collected gas to a central point, where it can be processed and treated \\ndepending on the ultimate use of the gas. LFG treatment removes moisture and other contaminants (e.g., \\nsiloxanes) that may disrupt the energy generation equipment (USEPA, 2010). Treatment requirements \\ndepend on the end-use application. \\nThis analysis considers four alternative technologies under this abatement measure that include \\ninternal combustion engine, gas turbine, micro-turbine, and combined heat and power (CHP) approach. \\nTable 1-3 summarizes the typical costs for the alternative electricity-generating technologies. \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Cost: Capital cost includes the costs of the collection and flare system discussed and the \\ntreatment system, energy generation equipment, and interconnection equipment for selling \\nelectricity to the power grid.

Under this option, LFG \\ncollected at the landfill is pumped to a nearby (< 5 miles) end user. The gas delivered can serve as a \\nmedium-BTU fuel for boiler or drying operations, kiln operations, and cement and asphalt production. 5 \\nAlthough little condensate removal and filtration is needed, combustion equipment might need slight \\nmodifications to run with LFG (USEPA, 2010). However these modification costs are not considered part \\nof the technology costs. \\nThere is no cost-effective way to store LFG, so ideally the LFG consumer has a steady annual gas \\ndemand compatible with the landfill\\u2019s gas flow. If a landfill does not have adequate flow, the LFG can be \\nused to power only a portion of the machinery or mixed with other fuels. The cost for a gas compression \\nand treatment system includes compression, moisture removal, and filtration equipment necessary for \\ntransporting and using the gas. \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Cost:6 The capital costs for direct use include the equipment and installation cost of a \\nskid-mounted filter, compressor, and dehydrator, and the cost to construct a gas pipeline to carry \\nthe gas to a nearby (< 5 miles) end user(s). Filter, compressor, and dehydrator costs are scaled to \\nthe project\\u2019s expected minimum LFG flow and equal to approximately $300 per cfm. Pipeline \\nconstruction costs are assumed to be $320,000 per mile. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Cost: Annual O&M costs include the cost of electricity and maintenance of the filters, \\ncompressors, and dehydrators. The electricity costs are calculated by multiplying electricity price \\ntimes the energy required to power the equipment and transmit gas to end users, assuming a \\nsystem power demand of 0.002 kWh/ft3. Non energy-related O&M costs are scaled to LFG project \\nvolumes assuming a cost of $0.0014/ft3. \\n\\u2022  \\nBenefits: Annual revenue accrues to the project through the sale of LFG to an end user at an \\nassumed price that is 80% of the current natural gas price; the discounted price reflects the lower \\nBTU content of the gas. There may also be local or national policies such as tax incentives, loans, \\nand grants available to landfill operators to incentivize LFG utilization. \\n\\u2022  \\nApplicability: This option is available to all basic landfills and engineered landfills. \\n\\u2022  \\nTechnical Efficiency: This analysis assumes a collection efficiency of 75% for basic landfills and \\n85% for engineered landfills and an end-use combustion efficiency of 98%. \\n\\u2022  \\nTechnical Lifetime: 15 years \\nEnhanced Oxidation Systems \\nEnhanced oxidation systems are considered mitigation technologies that exploit the propensity of \\nsome naturally occurring bacteria to oxidize CH4.7 By providing optimum conditions for microbial \\n5 Other direct use applications include use in infrared heaters, greenhouses, artisan studios, leachate evaporation, \\nand biofuel production. \\n6 It is important to note that direct use of LFG may require equipment modifications at the end-user site to handle the \\nlower BTU content of LFG or additional treatment systems to improve the energy content; these costs are not \\nconsidered part of this abatement measure\\u2019s project costs. Including these costs would increase project costs by more \\nthan $200,000 (USEPA, 2010). \\n7 Oxidation of methane entails mixing the gas (CH4) with oxygen (O2) and converting the CH4 to CO2 and water \\n(H2O). \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-9 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLANDFILLS \\nhabitation and efficiently routing landfill gases to where they are cultivated, a number of bio-based \\nsystems, such as temporary or long-term biocovers, passively or actively vented biofilters, and \\nbiowindows, have been developed that can alone, or with gas collection, mitigate landfill CH4 emissions. \\nThe previous non-CO2 mitigation report (USEPA, 2006) evaluated the use of a biocover consisting of a \\nclay cap topped by a soil cover. \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Cost: Capital costs are the incremental costs of enhanced oxidation systems above the \\ntraditional clay/soil cover.

The biogas recovery from the digestion process is not perfectly efficient and assumed to be \\n75% of total value, and the biogas composition is assumed 60/40% CH4/CO2 according to \\nEunomia (2008). Similarly, the efficiency of the biogas conversion to electricity in the gas engine is \\nassumed to be 37% as reported by Eunomia (2008).

The primary \\nobjective is to reduce the mass and the volume of the waste. A secondary objective is a lower \\nenvironmental impact of the waste after its deposition (i.e., low emissions of landfill gas, small amounts \\nof leachate, and a reduced settlement of the landfill body). Furthermore, MBT includes the separation of \\nuseful waste components for industrial reuse, such as metals, plastics, and refuse-derived fuel (RDF). \\nThere are three main types of biological treatment processes: (1) an aerobic stabilization system in \\nwhich the stabilized output is assumed to be sent to a landfill or used for land remediation/recovery \\nprojects, (2) an aerobic biodrying system producing an RDF with the reject stream sent to a landfill (after \\nundergoing an aerobic stabilization process), and (3) systems combining aerobic and anaerobic \\ntreatments in which the anaerobic process is used to produce biogas, followed by an aerobic process that \\nproduces a stabilized output that can be sent to a landfill. Because of the similarities that can be found \\nbetween Option (1) and composting, and Option (3) and AD, this analysis focuses on Option (2) in which \\nthe RDF is destined for energy generation. \\nTo produce RDF, both windrow and box systems are applied.

Only the most easily degradable compounds are metabolized so that the loss of \\ncaloric value is low. The dry material can be fractionated very easily, because adhesive substances were \\neliminated in the bio-process. Iron and nonferrous metals, as well as glass and minerals, are separated for \\nmaterial recovery. The remaining material has a calorific value of 15 to 18 MJ/kg, mainly due to the high \\ncontent of plastics, wood, and paper. It can be used as a substitute for fossil fuels in power stations and \\ncement kilns and in the production of process gases. Similar to the composting process, there is a small \\nlevel of fugitive CH4 emissions that accompany the aerobic degradation process as well as some N2O \\nemissions from NOx denitrification during the curing stages of the stabilization process. Representative \\nCH4 emissions of 0.01 kg/tonne of waste and N2O emissions of 0.02 kg/tonne of waste were obtained from \\nEunomia (2008). \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Costs: The plant\\u2019s capital cost includes the cost of land, facility, equipment, and air \\npollution control and monitoring devices. The analysis assumes a capital cost of $15 million \\nbased on reported facility costs of $244/design tonne (reported as \\u00a3150 British pounds/tonne) was \\nused for this analysis and obtained from Eunomia (2008). Costs are reported for a 60,000 tonne/yr \\nfacility in the UK. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual O&M Costs: The O&M cost of the MBT facility is $2 million in 2010. This cost includes \\nthe labor, overhead, taxes, administration, insurance, indirect costs, energy, and maintenance \\ncosts. It does not include residues disposal. A 2007 annual O&M cost of $22/tonne (reported as \\n\\u00a313 British pounds/tonne) was considered in this analysis and obtained from Eunomia (2008), \\nwhich presents costs typical of UK facilities. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Benefits: Annual revenues from the sale of RDF and recyclables that are produced from \\nthe MBT process are sold to an end user (i.e., cement kilns or coal-fired utility). According to \\nEunomia (2008), RDF is produced at a typical rate of 0.48 tonne/tonne of waste. Eunomia (2008) \\nalso reports that 1 tonne of RDF can be assumed to replace 0.90 tonne of coal used to fuel a \\ncement kiln and 0.38 tonne of coal for power generation. The market coal price of $40/tonne is \\nused to estimate the revenues. Similarly, Eunomia (2008) reports an 80% recovery rate for ferrous \\nmetals, 70% recovery rate for nonferrous metals, and 70% recovery rate for glass. Sale prices of \\n$352/tonne for ferrous metals (USGS, 2012), $1,881/tonne 11 for nonferrous metals, and $25/tonne \\nfor glass were used to estimate the revenues from recyclables sale. \\n\\u2022  \\nApplicability: This option applies to all landfill types \\n\\u2022  \\nTechnical Efficiency: This analysis assumes a reduction efficiency of 95%. \\n\\u2022  \\nTechnical Lifetime: 20 years \\nPaper Recycling \\nRecycling typically consists of two major processes: the separation process at a material recovery \\nfacility (MRF) and the remanufacturing process where recyclables are used to produce new products. For \\nconsistency with other mitigation option included in this report, the costing component of this analysis \\nonly considers the separation process. The different types of MRFs vary according to the type of waste \\nthey receive and the destination of the recyclables (e.g., mixed waste MRF, commingled recyclables MRF, \\npresorted recyclables MRF, co-collection MRFs, and front-end MRFs to other waste diversion alternatives \\nsuch as composting). Because it is the most common, this analysis considers a mixed waste MRF. \\n11 Price obtained from MetalPrices.com at http://www.metalprices.com/FreeSite/metals/al_scrap/al_scrap.asp#Tables. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-13 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLANDFILLS \\nUnder the mixed waste MRF design, mixed waste is typically collected at curbside and dumped on a \\ntipping floor at the MRF. It is then loaded onto a conveyer by using a front-end loader or Bobcat. This \\nconveyer feeds a bag opening station because most waste is collected in bags. Undesirable items in the \\nwaste (e.g., white goods, bulky items) are removed from the mixed waste before and after the bag \\nopening point in the MRF. Bags can be opened either manually or mechanically, and this analysis \\nconsiders mechanical bag opening. Loose waste from the bag opening operation is then conveyed into an \\nelevated and enclosed sorting room where the recyclables are recovered. Newsprint, old corrugated \\ncardboard, and other paper can be picked from the mixed waste as individual components. Because other \\npaper components are present in small quantities and are likely to be wet and contaminated, they can \\nonly be recovered as mixed paper. Metal cans remain in the refuse on the conveyer at the end of the sort \\nroom. Separation of aluminum cans can be manual or automated, and this analysis assumes manual \\nseparation. Ferrous metal is assumed to be recovered by a magnet. \\nApart from power consumption, no residual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are assumed, and the \\nMRF facility costs are divided into three components: capital cost, O&M cost, and revenue from \\nrecyclables sale. \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Costs. The capital cost for this option is $35 million in (2010 USD). The capital cost \\nconsists of construction, engineering, and equipment costs. It assumes a handling capacity of \\n100,000 tonnes of waste per year. This analysis relies on a $297/tonne of annual capacity (2006 \\nprices), which is an average of reported capital costs from CalRecycle (2009) for similar sized \\nfacilities. \\n\\u2022  \\nO&M Cost. The O&M cost of the MRF facility includes wages, overhead, equipment and \\nbuilding maintenance, and utilities. An O&M cost of $66/tonne of annual waste capacity before \\nresidue disposal, based on reported operating costs used in CalRecycle (2009) report. The cost of \\ndisposal of the MRF rejects can be estimated assuming an MRF separation efficiency of 55% of the \\nincoming organic waste and that the rejects are sent to a regular landfill with a tipping fee of \\n$29/tonne, which represents a U.S. national average tipping fee obtained from Municipal Solid \\nWaste Facility Directory (Chartwell, 2004). \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Benefits: Annual benefits come from the sale of recyclables and decreased waste. The \\nrecyclables that are separated at the MRF are sold to an end user (e.g., a remanufacturing facility) \\nsometimes through brokers. The 55% separation efficiency and recyclables sale prices were used \\nto estimate the revenues from recyclables sale. The following prices were used in the analysis: \\nmixed paper 12\\u2014$140/tonne; scrap metals 13\\u2014$1,307/tonne; and scrap glass\\u2014$25/tonne.

Municipal waste is incinerated to reduce its volume to save landfill costs \\nand recover energy from its combustion either for heating and/or electricity generation. The two most \\nwidely used and technically proven incineration technologies are mass-burn incineration and modular \\nincineration. Fluidized-bed incineration has been employed to a lesser extent, although its use has been \\nexpanding and experience with this relatively new technology has increased. RDF production and \\nincineration have also been used, primarily in Europe, but the number of successful cases is limited. This \\nanalysis considers WTE using mass-burn incineration and electricity recovery, which is the most common \\nWTE design. Representative CH4 emissions of 0.2 to 60 kg/Gg of waste (wet weight) and N2O emissions \\nof 41 to 56 g/ton of waste (wet weight) were obtained from IPCC (2006). WTE facility costs are divided \\ninto three components: capital cost, O&M cost, and revenue from electricity generation. \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Costs. The plant\\u2019s capital cost of $165 million includes the facility design engineering and \\nconstruction. Capital equipment includes the cost of land, incinerators, ash handling system, \\nturbine, and air pollution control and monitoring devices. Costs assume $829/tonne of design \\ncapacity. This cost was derived from Eunomia (2008), which describes this cost for a 200,000 \\ntonne/yr facility in the UK. \\n\\u2022  \\nO&M Cost. The annual O&M cost of the WTE facility is $8 million, approximately 4% of installed \\ncapital costs. Annual costs include labor, overhead, taxes, administration, insurance, indirect \\ncosts, auxiliary fuel cost, electricity cost, and maintenance cost. It does not include the cost for \\ndisposing of the combustion residue and spray dryer residue. Cost is based on annual O&M cost \\nof $41/tonne/yr. Annual avoided landfilling is also included as a cost savings. The cost of disposal \\nof the fly and bottom ash from the incineration process assumes an estimated 15% of the \\nincoming organic waste will be converted to ash (MSW DST Documentation). No reuse of the \\nbottom ash (e.g., in construction projects) is assumed and the bottom and fly ash will be mixed \\nand sent to a landfill. Both the avoided landfilling costs and residual waste landfilling costs \\nassume a tipping fee of $29/tonne. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Benefits: Annual revenue from electricity sales. Electricity that is generated by \\nrecovering heat from combusting waste is sold to an end user. The recovery of the heat is not \\nperfectly efficient. This inefficiency is represented by the heat rate of the plant, reported as 18,000 \\n(BTU/kWh) in the WTE process model documentation of the MSW DST (MSW DST \\nDocumentation). The electricity produced per tonne of waste can then be estimated according to \\nthe heat value of the waste incinerated (4,750 BTU/tonne of waste).

MAC curves are produced for 195 countries using \\ncountry specific parameters, such as wage rates and energy prices. \\nThis section describes the general modeling approach applied in the landfill sector as well as the \\napproach used to define the international facility populations and the assessment of sectoral trends. \\nThese factors serve as additional inputs to the MAC analysis that adjust the abatement project costs, \\nbenefits, and the technical abatement potential in each country. \\nIII.1.4.1 \\nMethodological Approach \\nThe overarching modeling framework applied in the landfill sector is captured in two basic steps. The \\nfirst is to calculate the break-even price for each mitigation measure for each facility type by country. The \\nsecond is to determine the country-level abatement potential. \\nThe break-even price, as defined in the technical summary to this report, estimates the costs and \\nexpected benefits of each technology based on the characteristics of the model facility and relative \\ninternational prices (equipment, labor, and energy). \\nCountry abatement potential reflects the number of abatement measures available and technical \\neffectiveness of each option. Figure 1-3 illustrates the conceptual modeling for estimating the abatement \\npotential in the landfill sector. \\nThe MAC model uses a three-step approach to allocating a fraction of the BAU emissions to each \\nfacility and technology considered. The model starts by splitting the BAU emissions out to our three \\nlandfill types (open dump, basic landfill, engineered landfill). Next the model uniformly distributes BAU \\nemissions by the number of abatement measures considered. Finally, the model estimates abatement \\npotential by multiplying the BAU emissions (indexed by facility type and technology) by each \\ntechnology\\u2019s technical effectiveness. Summing over all abatement measures and facility type indicates \\nthis product yields a country\\u2019s abatement potential. \\nIt is important to note that depending on the scenario considered in the model, diversion options may \\nor may not be included. As shown in Figure 1-3, if diversion options are considered, BAU emissions \\n(indexed by facility type) are uniformly distributed by the total number of technologies (N = 12). If \\ndiversion options are omitted, BAU emissions are distributed by the number of landfill-based mitigation \\ntechnologies (N = 7). \\nAssessment of Sectoral Trends \\nUnderlying the general modeling approach, the MAC analysis also incorporated additional \\ninternational considerations to capture shifts in the share of BAU emissions allocated to the three model \\nlandfill types defined earlier in Section III.1.2 (i.e., open dump, basic landfill, and engineered landfill). \\nTable 1-4 presents the facility share of BAU emissions over time. In the United States and the EU, we \\nassumed advanced waste management practices were already in place. Reflecting this assumption, we \\nassumed zero emissions coming from open dumps in these countries and assumed all emissions come \\nfrom basic and engineered landfills. Given the existing level of infrastructure in place there is very little \\nchange in the assumed distribution over the 20-year modeling horizon. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-16 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLANDFILLS \\nFigure 1-3: \\nConceptual Model for Estimating Mitigation Potential in the MSW Landfill Sector \\nFor emerging economies and developing countries the analysis assumes a greater share of emissions \\nis represented by open dumps in 2010.

Both \\nparameters were calculated based on the composition of the waste being landfilled, which is determined \\nby the country-specific socioeconomic conditions, consumption patterns, and waste management \\npractices. Therefore, the methane generation results and, consequently, the amount of methane \\npotentially mitigated by each landfill gas control measure are driven by the waste composition, which is \\nrelated to consumption patterns and socioeconomic conditions. We grouped the countries according to \\nthe following logic: \\nFirst, we identified the decay constant (k) and CH4 generation potential of waste (L0) for 16 countries \\nthat included at least 1 country within the each major region (Africa, Asia, Caribbean/Central & South \\nAmerica, Eurasia, Europe, Middle East, and North America). This information was obtained from a \\nnumber of sources, including international studies conducted by the World Bank, USEPA\\u2019s voluntary \\nprogram, the MSW Decision Support Tool (DST), and other peer-reviewed literature. \\nSecond, we then used expert judgment, taking into consideration trends of socioeconomic and \\ntechnological development to associate countries with other countries for which we have methane \\ngeneration data (e.g., we have methane generation data for Jordan and considered that Algeria, Egypt, \\nand South Africa have similar socioeconomic and technological conditions). Alternatively, we have \\nmethane generation data for Guinea, but we think that the socioeconomic and technological conditions in \\nEgypt, Algeria, and South Africa are closer to those in Jordan than to those in Guinea. \\nTable 1-6 presents the data used to characterize the model facilities for specific countries identified for \\nthis analysis. \\nThe international assessment of other OECD countries assumes waste management practices and \\nlandfill designs similar to those in the United States. For this reason, we leverage the existing United \\nStates-based landfill population, scaling the landfill size and emissions to meet projected baselines. For all \\nnon-OECD countries for which we had no data, we developed three model facilities to represent the \\nallocation of waste to each type of waste management facility (i.e., engineered landfill, sanitary landfill, \\nand open dump). Each facility type was assumed to have similar characteristics in terms of capacity, \\naverage depth of waste in place, and annual waste acceptance rates. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-19 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLANDFILLS \\nTable 1-6: \\nCH4 Generation Factors by Country \\nCH4 Gene\\nration F\\nactors by C\\nountry\\n1CCSA = Central & South America \\nSources: WB\\u2014World Bank Studies by Country; LMOP\\u2014USEPA\\u2019s LMOP country-specific landfill gas models; MSW DST\\u2014decision support \\nmodel; and Zhu et al.

The MAC curves illustrate the increase in abatement achievable at higher \\ncarbon prices. In 2030, the MAC curves show that approximately 589 MtCO2e, or 61% of global baseline \\nCH4 emissions from landfills, can be abated by adopting mitigation and avoidance options presented in \\nSection III.1.3. \\nApproximately 112 MtCO2e, or 19% of global abatement potential has a break-even price of zero or \\nless. These mitigation options are sometimes referred to as \\u201cno regret\\u201d options because the benefit cost \\nanalysis implies that they would have a positive return. However, as discussed previously, there may be \\ntransaction costs not captured in this analysis that are currently limiting their adoption. \\nAt break-even prices between $20/tCO2e to $50/tCO2e most countries MAC curves become non \\nresponsive (vertical). This is because there are few options within this break-even range. Between \\n$50/tCO2e to $100/tCO2e an additional 20% of abatement potential becomes economically viable. And, at \\nbreak-even prices (> $100/t CO2e) the remaining set of emission reduction options are economically \\nviable, but at extremely higher prices. The point at which the MAC becomes unresponsive to any price \\nchange can also be considered the full technical potential associated with the suite of abatement measures \\nconsidered. Thus, it can be inferred that additional reductions beyond approximately 60% of the \\nprojected baseline in 2030 would be unlikely without additional policy incentives or technology \\nimprovements. \\nTable 1-9: \\nAbatement Potential by Region at Selected Break-Even Prices in 2030 (MtCO2e) \\nAbatement Poten\\ntial by Region at Selected \\nBre\\nak\\n-E\\nve\\nn P\\nric\\nes \\nin \\n203\\n0\\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-22 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLANDFILLS \\nFigure 1-4: \\nMarginal Abatement Cost Curve for Top 5 Emitters in 2030 \\n-$30 \\n-$20 \\n-$10 \\n$0 \\n$10 \\n$20 \\n$30 \\n$40 \\n$50 \\n$60 \\n0.0 \\n5.0 \\n10.0 \\n15.0 \\n20.0 \\n25.0 \\n$/tCO2 e \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n30.0 \\nChina \\nMexico \\nMalaysia \\nRussia \\nUnited States \\nIII.1.4.3 \\nUncertainties and Limitations \\nUncertainty and limitations persist despite attempts to incorporate all publicly available information. \\nAdditional country-specific detailed information would improve the accuracy of the MAC projections. \\n\\u2022  \\nEnergy prices are negotiated on a case-by-case basis and may not be as high as the wholesale \\nprice used in the analysis. \\n\\u2022  \\nNational/regional or local policies for permitting projects may differ; also incentives such as tax \\ncredits, grants, loans and other financial incentives for LFG projects differ across states. \\n\\u2022  \\nAdditional data characterizing specific landfills are necessary for a more accurate financial \\nanalysis of each technology or specific project at a specific site.

In addition, domestic wastewater is also a source of \\nnitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. CH4 is produced when the organic material present in the \\nwastewater flows decomposes under anaerobic conditions. Although most developed \\ncountries rely on centralized aerobic wastewater treatment systems, which limit the level of CH4 \\ngenerated, less developed countries often rely on a broader suite of wastewater treatment technologies \\nwith a significant proportion of wastewater flows handled by anaerobic systems such as septic tanks, \\nlatrines, open sewers, and lagoons (USEPA, 2012a). \\nWorldwide CH4 from wastewater accounted for more than 500 MtCO2e in 2010. Wastewater is the \\nfifth largest source of anthropogenic CH4 emissions, contributing approximately 4% of total global CH4 \\nemissions in 2010. China, Nigeria, Mexico, India, and the United States, combined account for 60% of the \\nworld\\u2019s CH4 emissions from wastewater (see Figure 2-1). Global CH4 emissions from wastewater are \\nexpected to grow by approximately 19% between 2010 and 2030. \\nFigure 2-1: \\nCH4 Emissions from Wastewater: 2000\\u20132030 \\n0 \\n100 \\n200 \\n300 \\n400 \\n500 \\n600 \\n700 \\nMtCO2e \\n428 \\n512 \\n565 \\n2000 \\n2010 \\n2020 \\nYear \\n609 \\n2030 \\nUnited States \\nIndia \\nMexico \\nNigeria \\nChina \\nRest of World \\nSource: \\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). 2012a. \\nN2O emissions from human sewage are a second significant source of GHG emissions within the \\nwastewater sector, contributing an additional 2% of global N2O emissions in 2010.

As the marginal \\nabatement cost (MAC) curves show, high-cost mitigation measures in the wastewater treatment sector \\nconstrain the level of abatement achievable at lower carbon prices (less than $30 tCO2e-1) to less than 5% \\nof CH4 emissions in 2030. Maximum abatement potential (218 MtCO2e) is 36% of total CH4 emissions in \\nthe wastewater sector in 2030. \\nThe following section provides a brief explanation of sector activity, how CH4 and N2O emissions are \\ngenerated, and projected emissions from wastewater from 2010 to 2030.

The chapter concludes with a discussion of the MAC analysis approach unique to this \\nsector and presents the regional MAC results. \\n1 This analysis only assesses abatement measures to reduce CH4 emissions. Mitigation potentials reported in this \\nchapter do not consider potential reductions in N2O emissions, because of limited information on abatement measure \\ncosts. \\n2 Vertical axis is scaled to limited range of prices between $0 and $800/tCO2e.

Three key factors that determine the CH4 generation potential are the quantity \\nof degradable organic material present in the wastewater, the temperature, and the type of treatment \\nsystem used (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC], 2006). The organic content of \\nwastewater is typically expressed in terms of either biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) or chemical \\noxygen demand (COD) (IPCC, 2006; USEPA, 2012a). CH4 generation is positively related to temperature \\nso that higher temperatures result in a great amount of CH4 produced. The third key factor that \\ndetermines CH4 generation is the type of treatment system used and more specifically the amount of \\ndecomposition occurring under anaerobic conditions which is positively related the quantity of CH4 \\ngenerated. \\nTypes of centralized systems that can result in CH4 emissions include 1) aerobic systems that are \\neither improperly operated or designed to have periods of anaerobic activity and 2) anaerobic lagoons \\n(USEPA, 2012b). Most developed countries currently use centralized aerobic wastewater treatment \\nfacilities with closed anaerobic sludge digester systems to process municipal and industrial wastewater, \\nminimizing CH4 emissions. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-29 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWASTEWATER \\nThe IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas reporting identifies five major industrial \\nwastewater sources for CH4 emissions, which include pulp and paper manufacturing, meat and poultry \\nprocessing (slaughterhouses), alcohol/beer and starch production, organic chemicals production, and \\nother drink and food processing (e.g., dairy products, vegetable oil, fruits and vegetables, canneries, juice \\nmaking) (IPCC, 2006). The significance of CH4 emissions from the various industrial sources will depend \\non the concentration of degradable organics present in the wastewater flow, volume of wastewater \\ngenerated, the quantity of wastewater treated in anaerobic treatment systems (e.g., anaerobic lagoons). \\nIII.2.2.2 \\nN2O Emissions from Domestic Wastewater\\u2014Human Sewage \\nN2O is produced during both the nitrification and denitrification of urea, ammonia, and proteins. \\nThese waste materials are converted to nitrate (NO3) via nitrification, an aerobic process converting \\nammonia-nitrogen to nitrate. Denitrification occurs under anoxic conditions (without free oxygen) and \\ninvolves the biological conversion of nitrate into dinitrogen gas (N2). N2O can be an intermediate product \\nof both processes but is more often associated with denitrification (Sheehle and Doorn, 2002). \\nIII.2.2.3 \\nEmissions Estimates and Related Assumptions \\nThis section discusses the historical and projected baseline emissions for the wastewater sector. 3 \\nHistorical emissions are characterized as those emissions released between 1990 and 2010. Projected \\nemissions estimates cover the 20-year period starting in 2010 and ending in 2030. \\nHistorical Emissions Estimates \\nBetween 1990 and 2005, CH4 and N2O emissions from wastewater increased by 20% from a combined \\ntotal of 421 MtCO2e in 1990 to 505 MtCO2e in 2005. The primary driver of both CH4 and N2O emissions \\nassociated with wastewater is population growth. Country-level CH4 emissions are particularly sensitive \\nto population growth in countries that rely heavily on anaerobic treatment systems such as septic tanks, \\nlatrines, open sewers, and lagoons for wastewater treatment (USEPA, 2012a). \\nThe share each countries total emissions that is attributed to domestic versus industrial wastewater \\nsources is determined by the level of industrial activity and types of domestic wastewater treatment \\nsystems employed. In developing countries, domestic wastewater sources account for the majority if not \\nall of CH4 emissions from wastewater. In countries with industrial wastewater sources, the contribution \\nof industrial wastewater emissions will depend on the level of production and the commodity produced \\n(e.g. paper, sugar, alcoholic beverages, and processed meat/poultry/fish). Based on the UNFCCC\\u2019s \\nnational reporting inventory database of GHG emissions, only a small number of developed countries \\nhave historically reported CH4 emission from Industrial sources. For these 24 countries reporting \\nindustrial and domestic CH4 emissions the share of emissions reported for industrial wastewater ranged \\nfrom less than 2% to nearly 70% of total CH4 emissions from all wastewater sources. Section III.2.4 \\ndiscusses these distributions of emissions to domestic and industrial sources in more detail. \\nProjected Emissions Estimates \\nWorldwide CH4 emissions are projected to increase by approximately 19% (97 MtCO2e) between 2010 \\nand 2030. N2O emissions are projected to increase by a similar proportion, up 16% (14 MtCO2e) over the \\nsame time period. Tables 2-1 and 2-2 present the CH4 and N2O emissions projections for the wastewater \\nsector. \\n3 For more detail on baseline development and estimation methodology, we refer the reader to the USEPA\\u2019s Global \\nEmissions Projection Report available at: http://www.epa.gov\\\\climatechange\\\\economics\\\\international.html. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-30 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWASTEWATER \\nTable 2-1: \\nProjected CH4 Baseline Emissions from Wastewater: 2010\\u20132030 (MtCO2e) \\nProjecte\\nd CH4\\n Base\\nline \\nEmiss\\nions \\nfrom W\\nastewater 20\\n10-2030\\nCountry \\n2010 \\n2015 \\n2020 \\n2025 \\n2030 \\nCAGR \\n(2010\\u20132030) \\nTop 5 Emitting Countries \\nChina \\n17 \\n17 \\n17 \\n17 \\n17 \\n0.2% \\nUnited States \\n5 \\n5 \\n6 \\n6 \\n6 \\n0.9% \\nBrazil \\n5 \\n5 \\n5 \\n5 \\n6 \\n0.9% \\nRussia \\n4 \\n4 \\n4 \\n4 \\n4 \\n1.1% \\nIndia \\n3 \\n3 \\n3 \\n3 \\n4 \\n\\u22120.6% \\nRest of Region \\nAfrica \\n11 \\n13 \\n14 \\n15 \\n17 \\n1.8% \\nAsia \\n5 \\n5 \\n6 \\n6 \\n6 \\n1.0% \\nCentral & South America \\n4 \\n5 \\n5 \\n5 \\n6 \\n1.0% \\nEurasia \\n14 \\n14 \\n14 \\n14 \\n14 \\n0.1% \\nEurope \\n3 \\n3 \\n3 \\n3 \\n3 \\n0.0% \\nMiddle East \\n12 \\n13 \\n14 \\n14 \\n15 \\n1.3% \\nNorth America \\n3 \\n3 \\n3 \\n3 \\n3 \\n0.9% \\nWorld Total \\n86 \\n90 \\n93 \\n97 \\n100 \\n0.7% \\nSource: \\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). 2012a. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-31 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWASTEWATER \\nAs shown in Table 2-1, Africa and the Middle East are two regions projected to experience significant \\ngrowth in CH4 emissions over the next 20 years, increasing by 50% and 33%, respectively. CH4 emissions \\ngrowth in Asia and the Central and South American regions is also expected to be significant, growing by \\n25% over the same time period. \\nN2O emissions are expected to grow by similar proportions across all regions with the exception of \\nEurasia, where emissions are expected to remain relatively unchanged over the next 20 years. The \\nprimary driver of this trend is Russia\\u2019s 11% drop in N2O emissions between 2010 and 2030. Despite this \\ndecline, Russia still ranks as one of the top five emitters in 2030. \\nIII.2.3 \\nAbatement Measures and Engineering Cost Analysis \\nThis section characterizes the abatement measures considered for the wastewater sector. This analysis \\nfocused on domestic wastewater treatment and implementation of abatement measures aimed at \\nreducing CH4 emissions, which can be mitigated through investment in infrastructure and/or equipment. \\nConversely, there are no proven and reliable technologies for mitigation of N2O emissions. Mitigation \\nsteps to limit N2O emissions from wastewater treatment are operational, and include careful control of \\ndissolved oxygen levels during treatment, controlling the biological waste load-to-nitrogen ratio, and \\nlimiting operating system upsets. These measures require technical expertise and experience rather than \\nan engineered solution, thus they fall outside the scope of an engineered cost analysis. \\nIt is important to couch the discussion of greenhouse abatement measures for municipal wastewater \\nin the appropriate context. In practice, changes to wastewater management strategies in developing \\ncountries are unlikely to be driven by the mitigation of greenhouse gases. Factors such as economic \\nresources, population density, government, and technical capabilities are all important in determining \\nboth the current state and the potential for improvement to a country\\u2019s wastewater sanitation services. \\nFigure 2-4 is an illustration of the sanitation ladder, which relates the level of available wastewater \\nsanitation to the population and cost for treatment. The transition from a latrine to a sewer/wastewater \\ntreatment plant (WWTP)/anaerobic digester can increase the operation and maintenance wastewater \\ntreatment cost per person by a factor 20 (Guchte and Vandeweerd, 2004). This does not account for the \\ncapital cost that would be required in such large scale projects. \\nThe reader should bear in mind throughout the analysis that the wastewater sanitation technology is \\nlikely to be fixed by these external factors, and improvements in technology will be driven by the \\npopulation\\u2019s desire/capacity for improved sanitation and hygiene, with any improvements to greenhouse \\ngas emissions a secondary result of the change. Thus, although abatement measures are presented in this \\nchapter, they should not be considered to be a viable control measure that could be implemented for the \\nsole purpose of reducing a country\\u2019s GHG emissions, but rather a byproduct of a country\\u2019s position on \\nthe sanitation ladder. \\nThis analysis considers abatement measures that may be applied to one of five existing wastewater \\ntreatment systems currently being utilized in a given country. Scenarios 1 and 2 correspond to the upper \\nhalf of the sanitation ladder, while scenarios 3 through 5 correspond to the lower half the sanitation \\nladder. The five baseline scenarios for the existing status quo are presented in Figure 2-5. In actuality, \\nthere are many more than five baseline technology scenarios that may be utilized throughout the world, \\nwithin a country, or even within a municipality. For example, a population may utilize aerobic or \\nanaerobic ditches for centralized treatment of wastewater, which could be viewed as an intermediate \\noption between scenarios 1 and 2 in Figure 2-5. These baseline scenarios are not meant to be an \\nexhaustive list of the actual existing treatment technologies employed worldwide, but rather an attempt \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-32 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWASTEWATER \\nWastewater T\\nreatement\\nFigure 2-5: \\nFive Existing Scenarios Evaluated for Given Wastewater Discharge Pathways Based on \\nTechnology Level, Treatment Alternative, and Collection Method \\nDomestic \\nwastewater \\nCentralized \\ncollection \\nTreated \\n(1) Centralized \\nWWTP \\nUntreated \\n(2) (Open) \\nSewer \\nNo centralized \\ncollection \\nTreated \\n(3) Septic tank \\n(4) Latrine \\n(5) Other \\nsystem \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-33 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWASTEWATER \\nto broadly categorize and quantify technologies that represent the major classes of treatment technologies \\nemployed throughout the world. \\nDischarge pathways 1 and 2 (in Figure 2-5) assume the existence of a collection system for all \\nwastewater generated and are grouped according to the final disposal/treatment approach. Pathways 3, 4, \\nand 5 are the scenarios for which no existing centralized treatment exists and the waste is treated on site \\nwith latrines or septic tanks. For each of the five pathways and corresponding treatment systems, a \\nmitigation approach is evaluated for CH4 reduction. The analysis considers three abatement measures \\nthat include both mitigation technologies as well as complete shifts in wastewater management, that is, a \\njump up the sanitation ladder. \\nIt is important to note the distinction between the two types of abatement measures. Mitigation \\ntechnologies represent add-on technologies that can be applied to existing wastewater treatment systems \\n(such as an anaerobic digester with cogeneration) intended to capture and destroy the CH4 generated at \\nthe facility. The second type of abatement measure represents a shift away from an existing anaerobic \\nwastewater treatment approach to an aerobic system which in turn will reduce the volume of CH4 \\ngenerated during the treatment process. This shift in wastewater treatment approaches will require the \\nconstruction of a new facility that fundamentally changes the existing wastewater management approach. \\nThis approach usually requires construction of new infrastructure and, therefore, will require significant \\ncapital investment. As demonstrated in the cost analysis, the construction and operation and maintenance \\ncost per person is dependent on the population density of the region. For a collection system, more rural \\nareas require the more material (per person) to be used to build a system to collect and transport the \\nwaste. \\nIII.2.3.1 \\nOverview of Abatement Measures \\nThis section discusses the abatement measures considered for this analysis.

In addition, \\nas discuss above regarding the baseline scenarios, there are dozens of wastewater technology options \\navailable to a population; this discussion highlights three major categories that represent shifts in water \\nmanagement or add-on technology. \\nIII.2.3.2 \\nCH4 Mitigation Technology for Existing Decentralized Treatment \\nThis section characterizes the reduction in CH4 emissions by adding a collection system and \\ncentralized treatment facility in developing countries where the current practice is decentralized \\nwastewater treatment. As shown in Figure 2-6, this approach necessitates two large-scale capital \\ninvestments: the construction of a sewerage system for centralized collection and the construction of an \\nanaerobic WWTP. \\nWastewater Collection System\\u2014New Construction \\nFor areas of the developing world without centralized wastewater treatment, latrines and/or septic \\ntanks are typically used to dispose of domestic wastewater. In both of these cases, the organic matter in \\nthe wastewater will undergo anaerobic degradation to produce CH4. The construction and \\nimplementation of a collection system and subsequent treatment at a centralized facility would \\nsignificantly reduce CH4 formation because transporting wastewater through sewers promotes aerobic \\nconditions and reduces the fraction of organic content that undergoes anaerobic digestion. \\nThe design and size of a wastewater collection system depend on the population served, the service \\narea size, and water use characteristics of the population. Wastewater collection systems link all \\nhousehold and commercial discharges through underground piping, conveying the water to either a \\ncentralized treatment facility or directly to an outfall point where it is released into the environment. \\nPipelines can vary from 6 inches in diameter to concrete-lined tunnels up to 30 feet in diameter. \\nCollection systems are built with a gradient so gravity can facilitate the water flow; where there are large \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-35 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWASTEWATER \\ndistances that must be covered, periodic pump stations (also called lift stations) are sometimes used to \\npump the sewage to a higher elevation and again allow gravity to transport the sewage.

This scenario evaluates the impact of installing a sewer collection \\nsystem without a centralized treatment facility. \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Cost: The cost estimation model Water and Wastewater Treatment Technologies \\nAppropriate for Reuse (WAWTTAR) (Finney and Gearheart, 2004) was used to determine the \\ncapital cost of the sewer construction. The model is used by engineers, planners, decision makers, \\nand financiers to estimate the costs of making improvements to wastewater treatment systems \\nwhile minimizing impacts to water resources.

A WWTP typically comprises many unit operations from each of these broad categories. \\nWastewater treatment technologies are also divided into stages of treatment, each of which comprises one \\nor more individual treatment processes. A brief summary of each of these classifications is as follows: \\n\\u2022  \\nPretreatment: This stage involves the removal of wastewater constituents. These constituents can \\ninclude rags, sticks, floatables, grit, and grease that may cause maintenance or operational \\nproblems with the treatment operations, processes, and ancillary systems. Screening methods are \\nemployed here, suing bars, rods, grates, or wire meshes. \\n\\u2022  \\nPrimary treatment: This stage focuses on the removal of a portion of the total suspended solids \\n(TSS) and organic matter from the wastewater. Primary treatment is a physical unit process in \\nwhich the sewage flows into large tanks, known as primary clarifiers or primary settling tanks. A \\nsettling tank is constructed of concrete and designed so that the residence time of the wastewater \\nis such that the flow slows down enough so that readily settleable particles are collected at the \\nbottom of the tank. \\n\\u2022  \\nSecondary treatment: This stage focuses on the removal of biodegradable organic matter (in \\nsolution or suspension) and TSS by aerobic or anaerobic biological treatment. Disinfection is also \\ntypically included in the definition of conventional secondary treatment. Secondary treatment is \\na biological process that cultivates and uses a consortium of microorganisms to degrade the \\norganic wastes and reduce nutrient levels in wastewater. Secondary treatment can either be \\naerobic (with oxygen) or anaerobic (without oxygen). By far, the most common approach used in \\nWWTPs is the activated sludge process. This process is an aerobic suspended-growth system \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-36 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nWASTEWATER \\ncontaining a biomass that is maintained with oxygen and is capable of stabilizing organic matter \\nfound in wastewater. During the activated sludge process, the effluent flows into a concrete tank \\nwhere air or oxygen is bubbled through the wastewater to encourage microbial degradation of \\nthe organic material. The treated effluent flows to a secondary settling tank, where it is separated \\nfrom the biomass. Most of the biomass collected at the bottom of the settling tank is removed for \\nfurther dewatering and stabilization before final disposal. A small fraction of the biomass is \\nrecycled back into the bioreactor to maintain the population. It is important to monitor proper \\ncontrol of oxygen levels, pH, and the amount of sludge recycled back into the reactor to ensure \\nthat proper treatment levels of the wastewater are maintained. \\n\\u2022  \\nTertiary treatment: This stage involves the removal of residual suspended solids (after secondary \\ntreatment), usually by granular medium filtration or microscreens. Disinfection is also typically a \\npart of tertiary treatment. Nutrient removal is often included in this stage. \\nThe cost breakdown for this mitigation approach is as follows: \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Cost: Capital costs were estimated using EPA cost curves detailing the construction costs \\nof publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities (USEPA 1980). The costs curves in this report \\nare based on actual winning bids for treatment plans, which include detailed equipment and \\nmaterials requirements, including labor, amortization, land, concrete, pumps, pipes, power, \\nhaulage, chemicals, and design fees.

An anaerobic WWTP typically comprises many unit operations divided into stages of \\ntreatment: pretreatment, primary treatment, secondary treatment, and tertiary treatment. \\nThe cost breakdown for this mitigation approach is identical to that above and is as follows: \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Cost: Capital costs were estimated using EPA cost curves detailing the construction costs \\nof publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities.

The significant quantity of biomass generated during the \\ndecomposition of the sewage is a major operational component of WWTP operation. Typical approaches \\nto sludge handling include dewatering to reduce the overall volume and further water reduction in open-\\nair drying beds. The sludge is rich in organic matter and has the potential to produce high amounts of \\nCH4 during degradation. Anaerobic digestion is an additional sludge-handling step that can be employed \\nto further reduce the sludge volume; it is a process that involves the decomposition of this organic \\nmaterial in an oxygen-free environment to produce and collect CH4. Anaerobic digesters are large \\ncovered tanks that are heated to optimize the methane-generating process. The tanks typically employ a \\nmixing mechanism to ensure uniform conditions throughout the tank and are designed with headspace \\nto collect the gas generated, which is typically a mix of 60 to 70% CH4 and the 30 to 40% CO2, along with \\ntrace gases. The remaining solid material is nutrient rich and is a suitable fertilizer for land application. \\nThe heat from the flared gas can be used to heat the digester, lowering the overall energy requirements of \\nthe system. Alternatively, the gas can be used to produce electricity with a turbine. \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Cost: Costs were derived from EPA process cost curves for new construction of an \\nanaerobic digester.

For these 24 countries, we calculated a 5-year average share of CH4 emissions attributable to \\ndomestic sources based on emissions reported between 2002 and 2007. For all other countries, because of \\na lack of data, we assumed emissions projections are wholly attributable to domestic wastewater \\ntreatment systems to be consistent with USEPA (2012a) projections methodology.

If these additional \\nsocial benefits were included, it would result in higher levels of abatement achievable at lower break-\\neven prices. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-42 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWASTEWATER \\nTable 2-5: \\nAbatement Potential by Region at Selected Break-Even Prices in 2030 \\nBreak-Even Price ($/tCO2e) \\nCountry/Region \\n\\u201310 \\n\\u20135  \\n0 \\n5  \\n10 \\n15 \\n20 \\n30 \\n50 \\n100 \\n100+ \\nTop 5 Emitting Countries \\nChina \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n2.9 \\n2.9 \\n11.1 \\n11.1 \\n13.0 \\n49.7 \\nIndonesia \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n1.3 \\n1.3 \\n4.4 \\n4.4 \\n5.0 \\n18.8 \\nMexico \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n3.8 \\n3.9 \\n20.9 \\nNigeria \\n\\u2014 \\n1.4 \\n1.4 \\n1.4 \\n5.2 \\n5.2 \\n5.2 \\n5.2 \\n5.2 \\n8.0 \\n21.9 \\nUnited States \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n14.3 \\nRest of Region \\nAfrica \\n0.2 \\n0.5 \\n0.7 \\n0.9 \\n0.9 \\n1.4 \\n1.5 \\n1.6 \\n1.8 \\n3.2 \\n10.8 \\nAsia \\n\\u2014 \\n0.7 \\n0.8 \\n0.9 \\n2.0 \\n2.6 \\n2.6 \\n3.3 \\n5.7 \\n6.8 \\n21.1 \\nCentral and South America \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.2 \\n1.3 \\n1.8 \\n9.9 \\nEurasia \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n0.1 \\n0.1 \\n0.3 \\n0.7 \\n1.0 \\n8.9 \\nEurope \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n0.0 \\n5.5 \\n10.9 \\nMiddle East \\n\\u2014 \\n0.0 \\n0.5 \\n0.8 \\n1.2 \\n2.0 \\n3.5 \\n6.3 \\n7.0 \\n12.9 \\n30.9 \\nNorth America \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n0.2 \\nWorld Total \\n0.2 \\n2.6 \\n3.4 \\n4.0 \\n9.3 \\n15.5 \\n17.1 \\n32.4 \\n41.0 \\n61.2 \\n218.3 \\nFigure 2-11: Marginal Abatement Cost Curve for Top 5 Emitters in 2020 \\n$0 \\n$100 \\n$200 \\n$300 \\n$400 \\n$500 \\n$600 \\n$700 \\n$800 \\n0 \\n5 \\n10 \\n15 \\n$/tCO2 e \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n20 \\nChina \\nMexico \\nIndonesia \\nNigeria \\nUnited States \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-43 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWASTEWATER \\nIII.2.4.3 \\nUncertainties and Limitations \\nThe 2006 version of this report did not explicitly model any abatement measures. This analysis makes \\nan initial attempt at estimating the abatement potential that could be achieved in the wastewater sector. \\nThe previous report identified two major factors preventing the modeling of abatement in this sector. The \\nfirst was data limitations on the type of treatment systems currently employed in each country. The \\nsecond was the overriding economic and social factors influencing wastewater treatment practices and \\ninvestment throughout the world. \\nThe analysis presented in this chapter attempts to address the data limitations issue by estimating the \\nquantities of wastewater treated in a number of alternative treatment systems. For simplification \\npurposes, we have exogenously assigned abatement measures to specific existing wastewater treatment \\nsystems. Ideally, one would have significantly more data on existing treatment pathway types to support \\nthe incorporation of substitutable abatement measures when the investment decision is driven by cost \\nminimization under country- and system-specific conditions. \\nThe investment in large-scale public infrastructure required to improve wastewater treatment \\nsystems would not be determined solely by the carbon price associated with CH4 emissions reductions. \\nThe public health benefits of such large-scale sanitation infrastructure projects greatly outweigh the \\npotential benefits provided through any carbon market mechanism. However, the analysis presented \\nhere estimates the level of abatement that is technically achievable and the marginal costs of supplying \\nreductions through these technologies, ignoring other potential positive externalities derived from \\nputting these systems in place. \\nFinally, this chapter does not consider the potential impact of abatement measures applied to \\nindustrial wastewater treatment systems. The authors acknowledge that CH4 emissions from industrial \\nsources can be significant, and in some countries industrial wastewater emissions may represent more \\nthan half of total emissions associate with wastewater. However, data limitations, specifically information \\non the types of treatment systems employed in specific industries and correspondingly the abatement \\nmeasures available to those systems is needed to estimate the abatement potential from industrial \\nsources. International partnerships like the Global Methane Initiative (GMI) have begun to assess the \\nlevel of CH4 emissions available for recovery and use. Any future attempt to model abatement potential \\nfrom the industrial wastewater sector would also require additional detail on the relative contribution of \\nCH4 emissions coming from domestic versus industrial wastewater sources. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIII-44 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWASTEWATER \\nReferences  \\nBogner, J., R.

Nitric and  Adipic  Acid Production  \\nIV.1.1 \\nSector Summary  \\nT\\nhe production of  nitric and adipic acid results in significant  nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions  as a \\nby-product.  Nitric and  adipic  acid are commonly used as feedstocks in the manufacture of a  \\nvariety of commercial products, particularly fertilizers  and synthetic fibers  (USEPA, 2012a).  \\nCombined global emissions of N2O from nitric and adipic acid production are shown in Figure 1-1. \\nGlobally, emissions have declined by about 13% (17 MtCO2e) over the past decade; however, over the \\nnext 20 years\\u20142010 to 2030\\u2014emissions are expected to increase steadily (~20%) growing by 24 MtCO2e \\nover the time period. This trend is largely due to increased demand for fertilizer (nitric acid is an input) \\nand increased demand for synthetic fibers (adipic acid is an input). In 2030, the United States, South \\nKorea, Brazil, China, and Ukraine are expected to be five largest emitters of N2O from nitric and adipic \\nacid production. \\nFigure  1-1:  \\nN2O Emissions from Nitric  and Adipic  Acid: 2000\\u20132030  \\nSource: USEPA, 2012a. \\nOver the coming decades, increased demand for adipic acid in Asia is expected to contribute to \\nhigher N2O emissions from adipic acid production, while abatement control technologies employed at \\nadipic acid production facilities in the 1990s in the United States, Canada, and some countries of the EU \\nare expected to reduce N2O emissions (USEPA, 2012a). Overall, increased global demand for adipic acid \\nis expected to have the effect of higher annual N2O emissions resulting from adipic acid production. In \\naddition, global N2O emissions from nitric acid are expected to increase as demand for nitrogen-based \\nfertilizer increases. Although concerns about nutrient run-off have caused some countries to reduce their \\ndemand for nitrogen-based fertilizer, growing world demand for agricultural commodities is expected to \\nhave the effect of increasing nitric acid production and, consequently, N2O emissions. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-1 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIV.1.2 \\nN2O Emissions from Nitric and Adipic Acid Production \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n-$30 \\n-$20 \\n-$10 \\n$0 \\n$10 \\n$20 \\n$30 \\n$40 \\n$50 \\n$60 \\n$/tCO2e \\n0 \\n20 \\n40 \\n60 \\n80 \\n100 \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n120 \\n140 \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\nNITRIC AND ADIPIC ACID PRODUCTION \\nGlobal abatement potential of N2O in nitric acid and adipic acid production is 98 and 115 MtCO2e in \\n2020 and 2030, respectively. These results are depicted in the sectoral marginal abatement cost (MAC) \\ncurves in Figure 1-2. As the MAC curves show, roughly 45% of the maximum abatement potential in each \\nyear is achievable at relatively low carbon prices (between $2 and $10 tCO2e-1). \\nFigure 1-2: \\nGlobal MAC for Nitric and Adipic Acid: 2010, 2020, and 2030 \\nThe following section provides a brief explanation of the manufacturing processes that result in the \\nformation of N2O emissions. Next we discuss the projected emissions from these processes out to 2030. \\nSubsequent sections characterize the abatement measures and present the cost of implementation and \\noperation for each. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the MAC analysis approach unique to this \\nsector and the regional results. \\nN2O emissions are closely correlated with the production of nitric and adipic acid. The following \\nsection discusses global production activity data, typical emissions factors, and baseline emissions \\nestimates of N2O from nitric and adipic acid production. The MAC analysis presented here starts by \\nassuming the projected emissions presented in USEPA\\u2019s 2012 Global Emissions Report (2012a). This \\nanalysis then derives industry activity from the USEPA emissions projections based on current industrial \\nactivity. \\nIV.1.2.1 \\nNitric Acid Production and Emission Factors \\nAmmonium nitrate production represents the largest demand market for nitric acid, with the \\nmajority of nitric acid being consumed by ammonium nitrate producers.

Nitric acid production \\nlevels closely follow trends in fertilizer demand (Mainhardt and Kruger, 2000). Trends in fertilizer \\ndemand vary widely across different regions of the world. For example, in Western Europe, because of \\nconcerns over nutrient runoff and nitrates in the water supply, use of nitrogen-based fertilizer has been \\nsignificantly reduced in the past couple of decades (USEPA, 2012a). Despite this trend, the European \\nFertilizer Manufacturers Association (EFMA) is predicting modest growth in demand of 1.3% annually \\nover this decade. In other parts of the world, a continued desire to secure domestic fertilizer production \\ncapacity to supplant reliance on imports in combination with expansions in capacity for large fertilizer \\nconsuming countries are expected to result in a net increase in nitrogen-based fertilizer production \\ncapacity between 2010 and 2015 (IFA, 2011). Globally, over the next several decades, increases in food \\nconsumption and demand for agricultural products will continue to put upward pressure on fertilizer \\ndemand, which, in turn, is expected to increase the demand and consumption of nitric acid. \\nThe actual number of nitric acid production plants globally is unknown. Previous reports cited by the \\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC)  have suggested the number to be between 255 and  \\n600.  More recent estimates suggest that  between 500 and 600 plants were in operation in 2010 (Kollmus  \\nand Lazarus, 2010).  The actual number is  uncertain  because many nitric acid plants  are often part of  \\nlarger integrated chemical  facilities that manufacture  products using nitric acid\\u2014in the  production of a  \\nwide range of chemical products such  as fertilizer  and explosives (Kollmus and Lazarus, 2010;  Mainhardt  \\nand Kruger, 2000).  \\nAs noted earlier, global nitric acid production is expected to increase over time. Projections in nitric \\nacid production levels by country are not publicly available. \\nThe IPCC reports that N2O emissions factors for nitric acid production also remain relatively \\nuncertain, because of a lack of information on manufacturing processes and emissions controls. The \\nemissions factor is estimated, based on the average amount of N2O generated per unit of nitric acid \\nproduced, combined with the type of technology employed at a plant. The IPCC uses a default range of 2 \\nto 9 kilograms N2O per ton of nitric acid produced. As a result, emissions factors for nitric acid \\nproduction plants may vary significantly based on the operating pressure of the plant, the type of \\nnitrogen oxide (NOx) control technology (if any) deployed on the plant, and whether N2O abatement has \\nbeen implemented. As shown in Table 1-1, N2O emission rates increase as the plant operating pressure \\nincreases. Furthermore, non-selective catalytic reduction (NSCR) is very effective at destroying N2O, \\nwhereas other technologies used to control NOx emissions, such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and \\nextended absorption, do not reduce N2O emissions. \\nTable 1-1: \\nIPCC Emissions Factors for Nitric Acid Production \\nProduction Process \\nN2O Emissions Factor  \\n(relating to 100%  pure acid)  \\nPlants with NSCRa (all processes) \\n2 kg N2O/tonne nitric acid \\u00b110% \\nPlants with process-integrated or tailgas N2O destruction \\n2.5 kg N2O/tonne nitric acid \\u00b110% \\nAtmospheric pressure plants (low pressure) \\n5 kg N2O/tonne nitric acid \\u00b110% \\nMedium pressure combustion plants \\n7 kg N2O/tonne nitric acid \\u00b120% \\nHigh pressure plants \\n9 kg N2O/tonne nitric acid \\u00b140% \\nSource: IPCC, 2006.  \\na Non-selective catalytic reduction (NSCR)  \\nThe IPCC notes that emissions factors as high as 19.5 kilograms N2O per ton of nitric acid produced \\nhave been previously estimated.

Therefore, the uncertainties associated with these emission factors may be higher than \\nlisted in Table 1-1. However, no uncertainty assessments other than the IPCC\\u2019s have been published, so \\nwithout more information, this analysis relies on the published values above. \\nIV.1.2.2 \\nAdipic Acid Production and Emission Factors \\nAdipic acid is used primarily in the production of synthetic fibers, predominantly as a precursor for \\nthe production on nylon 6,6 (The Chemical Company [CC], 2010a). As a result, production of adipic acid \\nis closely correlated with the world\\u2019s nylon production. Worldwide, the largest single use of adipic acid is \\nin carpet manufacturing, accounting for 30% of the market (USEPA, 2012a; Chemical Week, 2007). \\nGlobal demand for adipic acid is expected to increase over the next few decades, particularly in Asia, \\ndriven primarily by the growth in demand for synthetic fibers (i.e., nylon 6,6), particularly for use in \\ncarpet manufacturing. Nylon 6,6 accounts for approximately 90% of adipic acid demand; demand for \\nnylon is a strong indicator of future adipic acid demand (CC, 2010b). Future production of adipic acid is \\nexpected to closely following the demand trend for synthetic fibers. Figure 1-3 shows the share of adipic \\nacid production capacity by country in 2010. \\nFigure  1-3:  \\nAdipic Acid Production Capacity by Country: 2010  \\nGlobal capacity in 2010 was approximately 3 million metric tons, concentrated in the United States \\n(30%), the European Union (29%), and China (22%) (Schneider, Lazarus, and Kollmuss, 2010; USEPA, \\n2012b). In the same year, global production of adipic acid was approximately 2.5 million metric tons (CC, \\n2010a). Plants in located in Canada and the United Kingdom were recently shut down and two of four \\nfacilities in the United States were idle in 2009 and assumed to remain so in 2010 (USEPA, 2012b). \\nThe IPCC provides a default emissions factor of 300 kilograms \\u00b1 10% N2O per ton of adipic acid \\nproduced (IPCC, 2006). This emissions factor assumes that no N2O control system is in place. \\nAdditionally, this factor should be used only when national total data are available and plant-level data \\nare deemed unreliable. This factor was developed using laboratory experiments measuring the \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-4 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNITRIC AND ADIPIC ACID PRODUCTION \\nreactionary stoichiometry for N2O generation during the production of adipic acid (Mainhardt and \\nKruger, 2000). This emissions factor has been supported by some selected measurement at industrial \\nplants. The IPCC recommends using plant-specific data for those plants with abatement controls already \\nin place and reliable plant-level data (IPCC, 2006). \\nIV.1.2.3 \\nEmissions Estimates and Related Assumptions \\nThis section discusses the historical and projected baseline emissions from the production of nitric \\nand adipic acid.1 Historical emissions are characterized as those emissions released from the 1990 to 2010 \\nperiod and projected emissions estimates cover the period from 2010 to 2030. \\nHistorical Emissions Estimates \\nBetween 1990 and 2005, N2O emissions from nitric and adipic acid production decreased by 37% \\ndown from 200 MtCO2e in 1990 to 126 MtCO2e in 2005. Key factors that influence emissions are the \\ndemand for final products that include intermediates of nitric and adipic acid such as carpet and \\nfertilizers. Although demand for and production of nitric and adipic acid increased over the 1990 to 2005 \\ntime period, N2O emissions actually decreased over the period. The reductions in N2O emissions over \\nthis period were mostly due to the installation of abatement technologies in the adipic acid industry \\n(USEPA, 2012a). \\nProjected Emissions Estimates \\nTable 1-2 lists the combined projected N2O baseline emissions from nitric and adipic acid production \\nby country/region and year. Worldwide N2O emissions are projected to increase by approximately 21% \\n(24 MtCO2e) between 2010 and 2030. South Korea, Canada, and Brazil are expected to experience the \\nlargest percentage increase in baseline emissions over the 2010 to 2030 period, with increases of 93, 77, \\nand 68%, respectively. The United States is expected to have the second largest absolute increase (8 \\nMtCO2e) in emissions, which represents a 28% increase from 2010, while South Korea is expected to have \\nthe largest absolute increase (11 MtCO2e). \\nIV.1.3 \\nAbatement Measures and Engineering Cost Analysis \\nThis analysis considered four abatement measures applied to the chemical processes used to produce \\nnitric and adipic acid to reduce the quantity of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions released during the \\nproduction process. Thermal destruction is the abatement measure applied to the adipic acid production \\nprocess. The three remaining measures were applied to the nitric acid production process. \\nNitric acid facilities have the option of using specially designed catalysts to control N2O emissions. \\nThe location of catalyst placement within the nitric acid production process determines the catalyst \\ndesign, composition, and terminology. Abatement measures applicable to nitric acid are characterized by \\nwhere in the production process they are implemented. These options include primary abatement, \\nsecondary abatement, and tertiary abatement. Primary abatement measures occur within the ammonia \\nburner, preventing the formation of N2O. Secondary abatement measures such as homogeneous thermal \\ndecomposition and catalytic decomposition are installed at an intermediate point in the production \\nprocess, removing the N2O formed through ammonia oxidation. Tertiary abatement measures, such as \\ncatalytic decomposition and NSCR units are applied to the tail gas streams at the end of the nitric acid \\n1 For more detail on baseline development and estimation methodology, we refer the reader to the USEPA\\u2019s Global \\nEmissions Projection Report.

Thermal destruction is the combustion of off-gases \\n(including N2O) in the presence of methane. The combustion process converts N2O to nitrogen, resulting \\nprimarily in emissions of NO and some residual N2O (Ecofys, Fraunhofer ISIR, and \\u00d6ko-Institute, 2009). \\nFacilities may also employee a catalytic decomposition method to abatement N2O generated. The EU \\nEmissions Trading System [ETS] and CDM methodologies for this abatement measure suggest that heat \\ngenerated from the decomposition of N2O can be used to produce process steam for utilization in local \\nprocesses, substituting for more expensive steam generated using fossil fuel alone. For this analysis, we \\nassume the abatement measures\\u2019 conversion of N2O to nitrogen technical effectiveness is 95%.

Abatement measures \\ninclude thermal decomposition, catalytic decomposition inside or immediately following the ammonia \\nburner. Thermal decomposition, developed by Norsk Hydro in the 1990s, is better suited for inclusion in \\nnew plants, because it requires redesigning the reaction chamber immediately following the ammonia \\nburner. This design change can increase the capital cost of a new plant by 5 to 6% but has no impact on \\noperating costs (Perez-Ramirez, 2003). The catalytic decomposition option is better suited for retrofitting \\nand can be incorporated as an add-on technology at minimal cost. For this analysis, the catalytic \\ndecomposition costs were used as the representative costs of the secondary abatement option. \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Costs:  Capital costs include the purchase and installation  of the catalyst and any \\ntechnical modifications made to the production process. This analysis assumes  a capital cost of  \\n$3.5/tonne of HNO3  production  capacity2  and a plant capacity of 1,000 tHNO3/day.

The NSCR typically costs more than \\nother types of tertiary catalysts because it requires a reagent fuel, such as natural gas, propane, butane, or \\nhydrogen, to reduce NOX and N2O over a catalyst. If an NSCR system is used at a nitric acid plant that is \\ncollocated with other chemical processes, the costs of these reagent fuels may be lessened. For example, if \\nammonia is produced near the nitric acid production plant, the waste gas stream from ammonia \\nproduction is a hydrogen-rich gas stream that could be used as the reagent fuel for an NSCR. \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Costs: Capital costs include the purchase and installation of the NSCR unit and catalyst. \\nThis analysis assumes a capital cost of $12.6/tonne of HNO3 production capacity based on \\n$8.2/tHNO3 reported in 1991 USD (USEPA, 1991) scaled to 2010 USD using the Chemical \\nEngineering Plant Cost Index (CEPI).

Similar to the steps taken in other sectors, we \\ndeveloped an inventory of facilities that are representative of existing facilities. Next we applied the \\nabatement costs to calculate the break-even prices for each option and applicable facility pair. Finally, the \\nmodel estimates the mitigation potential based on the country-specific share of emissions attributed to \\nnitric versus adipic acid production. This analysis takes the N2O emissions projections (given) and \\nallocates emissions based on production process to derive the model facility inventories. \\nAdipic acid facilities are defined through a detailed inventory of the 23 production facilities \\nworldwide operating in 2010. While no comprehensive inventory was available for nitric acid plants, it is \\nbelieved that there are roughly 500 to 600 nitric acid plants globally (Kollmuss and Lazarus, 2010). \\nInstead, we developed a series of 4 model nitric acid production units based on plant characteristics \\nobtained from a detailed inventory of 67 nitric acid plants that varied in age and production processes.4 \\nAdipic Acid\\u2014Facility inventory \\nThe first step in the analysis was to determine the allocation of projected emissions to nitric and \\nadipic acid production by country. For example, in the United States, adipic acid production accounted \\nfor approximately 15% of total baseline emissions in 2010, while the majority of emissions were attributed \\nto nitric acid production. Once the share of baseline emissions is determined, the MAC model can assess \\nthe abatement potential on the technically applicable pool of emissions available for abatement. \\nTo estimate the technically applicable share of emissions, we developed a detailed inventory of \\noperational adipic acid plants in 2010. Adipic acid plants were used as the starting point because the \\nnumber of international adipic acid plants is small (<30 globally), supported by recent literature \\nproviding detail on existing plants in 2010 obtained from Schneider, Lazarus, and Kollmuss (2010). The \\ndetailed inventory includes 23 adipic acid production facilities operating in 11 countries totaling \\napproximately 3,000 kt of production capacity.5 Schneider and co-authors also identified the N2O \\nabatement technologies and plant utilization factors. Figure 1-4 summarizes the global adipic acid \\nproduction capacity breakdown by country, and facility counts are reported in parenthesis after the \\ncountry labels. The bottom-up inventory was used to estimate N2O emission from adipic acid production \\nby country. \\n4 While there are a number of different processes employed at nitric acid production facilities, single-pressure plants \\nare much more common in the United States. Based on information gathered, most nitric acid production plants were \\nconstructed to maximize the yield from stages two and three of the production process and, therefore, operate at high \\npressures. \\n5 Major changes to previously reported adipic acid inventories (Mainhardt and Kruger, 2000; Organisation for \\nEconomic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2004) includes the opening of 5 new plants in China between \\n2008 and 2009; and the closure of two plants located in Canada and the United Kingdom. In addition, a fourth plant \\nlocated in the United States was idle between 2008 and 2009 and assumed to continue to idle in 2010 (USEPA, 2012b). \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-10 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2 \\n0% \\n2% \\n1% \\n12% \\n0% \\n5% \\n10% \\n15% \\n20% \\n25% \\n30% \\nIndia (1) \\nUkraine (2) \\nItaly (1) \\nBrazil (1) \\nSingapore (1) \\nJapan (2) \\nSouth Korea (1) \\nFrance (1) \\nGermany (3) \\nChina (7) \\nUnited States (3) \\nShare of Global Production Capacity \\nProducing Country\\nwith N O Abatement \\nUnabated \\n2 \\n35% \\nNITRIC AND ADIPIC ACID PRODUCTION \\nFigure 1-4: \\nOperational Adipic Acid Production Facilities in 2010 by Share of Global Capacity \\nSource: Adapted from Schneider et al. 2010.  \\nNote: Facility counts are listed in parentheses beside country name.   \\nAlthough 11 countries currently produce adipic acid, only 4 countries (China, Ukraine, Japan, and \\nIndia) have operational facilities that are known to have no N2O emission controls in place. As the figure \\nshows, all but 15% of the adipic acid capacity has N2O abatement controls in place. The 15% of capacity \\nwith no N2O abatement controls is represented by the nine smallest facilities in the industry located in \\nChina (5), Ukraine (2), Japan (1), and India (1). \\nIn the 1990s, most of the adipic acid producers in developed countries voluntarily adopted N2O \\nabatement measures (Schneider et al., 2010; EcoFys, 2009, USEPA, 2012b). In 2005, with the establishment \\nof the CDM methodology for crediting N2O abatement projects at adipic acid plants, producers in \\ndeveloping countries began to adopt N2O abatement measures. Schneider and co-authors point out that \\nalthough the CDM methodology was effective in achieving N2O reductions in developing countries, it \\nwas limited to facilities that were in operation prior to 2005. \\nSince 2005, much of the growth in adipic acid production capacity has been in China, with five plants \\ncoming online between 2008 and 2009 (Schneider et al., 2010). Future growth is also projected to be highly \\nconcentrated in Asia (Global Industry Analysts Inc. [GIA], 2010). China alone is expected to see its \\ncapacity more than double in the near term with five new adipic acid plants between 2011 and 2013 \\n(Zhao, 2011). \\nOnly 15% of global capacity continues to operate with no known N2O abatement. China and Ukraine \\naccount for over 95% of the capacity with unabated N2O emissions. In China, the five plants operating \\nwithout abatement controls account for two-thirds of the country\\u2019s total adipic acid capacity. For this \\nanalysis, we assume that future abatement potential is limited to the nine plants identified as having no \\nknown N2O abatement measure in place. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-11 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNITRIC AND ADIPIC ACID PRODUCTION \\nAlthough no information was available on specific plant utilization rates, we assume utilization rates \\nof 60% for all non-CDM facilities, 85% for CDM facilities,6 and 45% for non-CDM facilities in other parts \\nof Asia (Schneider et al., 2011). Combining plant capacities and corresponding utilization rates yields a \\ntotal adipic acid production in 2010 of 1.84 million metric tons. \\nNext we estimate net emissions for each country by applying the IPCC emissions factor of 300 kg \\nN2O per metric ton of adipic acid produced to the plant production estimated above. Net emissions \\nestimated account for existing abatement activity assuming a control efficiency of 96%. This analysis \\nyields net emissions by country totaling 103,800 tonnes of N2O (32.2 MtCO2e) in 2010. \\nWe assume the net emissions calculated for each country represents adipic acid\\u2019s representative share \\nof total projected baseline emissions (see Table 1-2). Table 1-4 provides the percentages used to breakout \\nthe N2O emissions baseline to adipic acid. \\nThe analysis assumes that N2O emissions from adipic acid production account for the percentage of \\ntotal sectoral baseline listed in Table 1-4. We attribute the balance of baseline emissions to nitric acid \\nproduction. \\nTable 1-4: \\nAdipic Acid-Producing Countries\\u2019 Share of Baseline Emissionsa \\nShare of N2O Baseline, % \\nCountry \\nAdipic Acid \\nNitric Acid \\nBrazil \\n5  \\n95 \\nChinab \\n36 \\n64 \\nFrance \\n30 \\n70 \\nGermany \\n21 \\n79 \\nIndia \\n1  \\n99 \\nItaly \\n27 \\n73 \\nJapanb \\n36 \\n64 \\nSingapore \\n25 \\n75 \\nSouth Korea \\n5  \\n95 \\nUkraineb \\n36 \\n64 \\nUnited States \\n15 \\n85 \\nOther Countries \\n0  \\n100 \\na For China, Japan, and Ukraine, the more detailed inventory-based estimate of emissions developed for this analysis yielded emission values  \\ngreater than the total baseline projections for 2010.

Instead, we developed a \\nseries of 4 model nitric acid production units based on plant characteristics obtained from a detailed \\ninventory of 67 nitric acid plants that varied in age and production processes.

HFC Emissions from Refrigeration \\nand Air Conditioning \\nIV.2.1 \\nSector Summary \\nA\\nnumber of hydrofluorocarbons  (HFCs) are used in refrigeration and air conditioning (AC) \\nsystems and are emitted to the atmosphere during equipment operation, repair, and \\ndisposal, unless recovered, recycled and ultimately destroyed. The most common HFCs \\ninclude HFC-134a, R-404A, R-410A, R-407C, and R-507A.1 In response to the ozone depleting substance \\n(ODS) phaseout, equipment is being retrofitted or replaced to use HFC-based substitutes or intermediate \\nsubstitutes (e.g., hydrochlorofluorocarbons [HCFCs]) that will eventually need to be replaced by HFCs or \\nother non-ozone-depleting alternatives. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the refrigeration/AC \\nsector (excluding chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and HCFCs) were estimated at roughly 349 million metric \\ntons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2010. By 2020, emissions from this sector are expected to \\nreach 733 million MtCO2e, as shown in Figure 2-1. A majority of the growth will result from increased use \\nof HFCs in developing countries. \\nSource: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), 2012. \\nThis analysis reviews options to reduce emissions from the refrigeration/AC sector by using low-\\nglobal warming potential (GWP) refrigerants, low-emission technologies, and improved practices to \\nproperly recover refrigerant at equipment servicing and disposal. \\n1 R-404A, R-410A, R-407C, and R-507A refrigerant blends are composed of HFCs. Specifically, R-404A is 44% by \\nweight HFC-125, 52% HFC-143a, and 4% HFC-134a,. R-410A is 50% HFC-32 and 50% HFC-134a. R-407C is 23% HFC\\u00ad\\n32, 25% HFC-125, and 52% HFC-134a. R-507A (also called R-507) is 50% HFC-125 and 50% HFC-143a. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-19 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 2-2: \\nGlobal Abatement Potential in Refrigeration and AC: 2010, 2020, and 2030 \\n-$30 \\n-$20 \\n-$10 \\n$0 \\n$10 \\n$20 \\n$30 \\n$40 \\n$50 \\n$60 \\n$/tCO2e \\n0 \\n200 \\n400 \\n600 \\n800 \\n1,000 \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING \\nGlobal abatement potential from refrigeration and AC in 2030 as evaluated in this analysis equates to \\napproximately 70% of total annual emissions from refrigeration and AC end-uses and 28% of total \\nemissions from ODS substitutes. In the near-term, abatement opportunities within refrigeration and AC \\nare partially limited because many of the abatement options identified apply only to newly manufactured \\nequipment and are thus limited by the turnover rate of the existing refrigeration and AC stock. In \\naddition, this analysis does not explore new equipment abatement options for all refrigeration and AC \\nequipment types, although such options may exist. Marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve results are \\npresented in Figure 2-2. Maximum abatement potential of the options in the refrigeration and AC sector \\nexplored in this analysis is 540 MtCO2e in 2030. There are 317 MtCO2e of emissions reductions available \\nin 2030 that are cost-effective at currently estimated prices. \\nIV.2.2 \\nEmissions from Refrigeration and Air Conditioning \\nHFC emissions from refrigeration/AC occur during equipment manufacturing; as equipment is filled \\nwith coolant; during use, as a result of component failure, leaks, and purges; during servicing; and at the \\ntime of disposal, if the remaining refrigerant charge is not properly recovered. The use of refrigeration \\nand AC equipment also generates indirect emissions of GHGs (primarily carbon dioxide) from the \\ngeneration of power required to operate the equipment. HFC emissions can be reduced by adopting \\nalternative technologies (that either reduce HFC leakage or substitute the refrigerant for a low/no GWP \\noption) and by improving technician practices for equipment maintenance/servicing and disposal. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-20 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\nFigure 2-3: \\nGlobal HFC Emissions in 2020 by Application Type (% of GWP-Weighted Emissions) \\nSmall Unitary AC, \\n31% \\nLarge Unitary \\nAC, 2% \\nWindow Units & \\nDehumidifiers, 1% \\nPTAC/PTHP, <1% \\nPD Chillers, <1% \\nCentrifugal \\nChillers, 1% \\nLarge Retail Food, \\n31%\\nMedium Retail \\nFood, 2% \\nSmall Retail \\nFood, <1% \\nMVACs, 16% \\nRefrigerated \\nTransport, 8% \\nIPR, Cold \\nStorage, 6% \\nHousehold \\nRefrigerators, 1% \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING \\nFor the purpose of this analysis, the sector is characterized by six major end-use types, presented in \\ndescending order of 2020 GWP-weighted HFC emissions internationally (see Figure 2-3): \\n\\u2022  \\nresidential and commercial AC, including window units and dehumidifiers, large and small unitary \\nair conditioners (including both ducted and non-ducted split systems), centrifugal and positive \\ndisplacement chillers, and packaged terminal air conditioners and packaged terminal heat pumps \\n(PTAC/PTHP), used to regulate the temperature and reduce humidity in homes, apartment \\nbuildings, offices, hotels, shopping centers, and other large buildings, as well as in specialty \\napplications such as ships, submarines, nuclear power plants, and other industrial applications;

Additional options \\nconsidered but not yet included in the analysis are described in Sections IV.2.2.18 through IV.2.2.20. \\nSeveral other options, not mentioned below, are also potentially available but have not been included in \\nthis analysis. All costs are presented in 2010 dollars based on the Consumer Price Index (U.S. Department \\nof Labor, 2011). \\nIV.2.3.1 \\nEnhanced HFC-134a in New MVACs \\nThis option reduces annual leak rates of HFC-134a MVAC systems by 50% through better system \\ncomponents, including improved system sealing, lower permeation hoses, improved fittings, and higher \\nevaporator temperatures (USEPA and NHTSA, 2011). Enhanced HFC-134a systems are additionally \\nassumed to reduce fuel consumption by an estimated 42% through improved component efficiency, \\nimproved refrigerant cycle controls, and reduced reheat of the cooled air (USEPA and NHTSA, 2011). \\nThis option is applicable to a newly manufactured MVAC system in light duty vehicles5 in all \\ncountries except the EU, where it is assumed to penetrate in the baseline. The one-time cost is estimated \\nat roughly $73 per MVAC system\\u2014assumed to be 10% greater in developing countries. These costs are \\noffset by annual savings that result from reduced fuel and refrigerant consumption (a combined savings \\nof approximately $38 per system). In developing countries, fuel prices are assumed to be 30% greater, \\nresulting in a combined savings of approximately $48 per system. \\nIV.2.3.2 \\nHFO-1234yf in New MVACs \\nHFO-1234yf has a GWP of only four and performs similarly to HFC-134a, making the use of current \\nMVAC system designs with minimal changes feasible. HFO-1234yf is, however, slightly flammable \\n(designated 2L flammability in Addendum h to ANSI-ASHRAE Standard 34-2010), which may \\nnecessitate certain safety mitigation strategies. This option has already begun penetrating the EU and U.S. \\nmarkets in a couple models (Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Magazine, 2013). This option is assumed to \\nbe as efficient as conventional HFC-134a MVAC systems (Oko-Recherche et al., 2011; Koban, 2009). \\nThis option is applicable to a newly manufactured MVAC system in a light-duty vehicle in all \\ncountries except the EU, where it is assumed to penetrate the baseline market. The one-time capital cost is \\nestimated at approximately $59 per MVAC system, resulting from incremental refrigerant costs and \\nhardware changes the latter of which is assumed to be 10% greater in developing countries. Annual costs \\nare assumed to be approximately $8 per system associated with incremental refrigerant replacement \\ncosts. \\nIV.2.3.3 \\nEnhanced HFO-1234yf in New MVACs \\nAs a newly developed technology, HFO-1234yf MVAC systems may cost more than those currently \\ncontaining HFC-134a. Further, a lower global production of the chemical, combined with the additional \\nprocesses needed to produce it, is expected to lead to an initially high price for the chemical, but this may \\ndecrease as production increases. Similar to the Enhanced HFC-134a option, this option explores HFO\\u00ad\\n5 This category includes cars, pick-up trucks, minivans, and sport utility vehicles. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-25 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING \\n1234yf for use in new MVAC systems using improved system components to allow for 50% reduced \\nrefrigerant leakage and efficiency improvements of 42%. \\nThis option is applied to a newly manufactured MVAC system in light-duty vehicles in all countries. \\nThe one-time cost is estimated at roughly $100 per MVAC system, resulting from incremental refrigerant \\ncosts and better system components\\u2014the latter of which is assumed to be 10% greater in developing \\ncountries. The assumed incremental cost of the refrigerant is lower for this option than the original HFO\\u00ad\\n1234yf option on the basis that, over time with mass production of the chemical and systems to use it, the \\nprice will drop. Given this as well as the assumed lower leak rate of this option, annual costs are assumed \\nto be only approximately $2 per MVAC system. These costs are offset by annual savings that result from \\nreduced fuel consumption, equaling roughly $37 per system. In developing countries, fuel prices are \\nassumed to be 30% greater, resulting in a savings of almost $48 per system. \\nIV.2.3.4 \\nDistributed Systems in New Large Retail Food \\nA distributed system consists of multiple compressors that are distributed throughout a retail food \\nstore (e.g., a supermarket), near the display cases they serve, and are connected by a water loop to a \\nchiller or other type of equipment that rejects heat (e.g., a cooling tower) that is located on the roof or \\nelsewhere outside the store. Because distributed systems have smaller refrigeration units distributed \\namong the refrigerated and frozen food display cases, refrigerant charges for distributed systems can be \\nsmaller than the refrigerant charge used in a comparable traditional centralized direct expansion (DX) \\nsystem. The reduction in original charge size of the system will reduce HFC consumption (at first fill) and \\nreduce potential emissions at the end of the equipment\\u2019s life. Additionally, because of the placement of \\nthe units, a distributed system can require less refrigerant tubing and fittings than DX systems, thereby \\nreducing total HFC leaks during the useful lifetime of the equipment to an estimated 80% relative to \\nconventional systems. However, distributed systems are estimated to be 5% less efficient than \\nconventional HFC centralized DX systems (IPCC, 2005). This technology is already being implemented \\ntoday in many developed countries. \\nThis abatement option is applied to a newly manufactured large retail food system in a large \\nsupermarket. In developed countries, one-time costs are estimated to be 5% more expensive than \\nconventional HFC centralized DX systems (IPCC, 2005), equivalent to an incremental cost of about $9,100 \\nper supermarket; these costs are estimated to be 10% greater in developing countries. Annual costs are \\nestimated at nearly $3,700 per supermarket in developed countries due to higher electricity consumption; \\nthese annual electricity costs are estimated to be 66% greater in developing countries. At the same time, \\nannual refrigerant savings (due to reduced leakage) are realized, totaling nearly $1,800 per supermarket. \\nIV.2.3.5 \\nHFC Secondary Loop and/or Cascade Systems in New Large Retail Food \\nSecondary loop systems use two fluids: a primary refrigerant and a secondary fluid. The secondary \\nfluid is cooled by the primary refrigerant in the machine room and then pumped throughout the store to \\nremove heat from the display equipment. In supermarkets, secondary loop systems are also sometimes \\nused in combination with a cascade system. Cascade designs consist of two independent refrigeration \\nsystems that share a common cascade heat exchanger. The heat exchanger acts as the low temperature \\nrefrigerant condenser and serves as the high temperature refrigerant evaporator. Each component of a \\ncascade design uses a different refrigerant that is most suitable for the given temperature range, with CO2 \\ncommonly used in the low temperature circuit and an HFC used as the refrigerant at the medium \\ntemperature phase (RTOC, 2011). Because the HFC refrigerant is contained in the machine room in a \\nsecondary loop system and is not required for use in the low temperature circuit of a cascade design, \\nthese systems require a significantly lower refrigerant charge and have lower leakage rates, resulting in \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-26 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING \\napproximately 90% less annual leakage. While historically these systems were less efficient than \\nconventional DX systems, today these systems are found to be just as efficient as conventional DX \\nsystems, if not more so, due to simplified piping, newly designed circulating pumps, and fewer \\ncomponents (Wang et al., 2010; DelVentura, et al., 2007; SuperValu, 2012; WalMart, 2006; Hinde, Zha, and \\nLan, 2009). \\nThis abatement option is applied to a newly manufactured large retail food system in a large \\nsupermarket. The one-time cost in developed countries is estimated to be 17.5% more expensive than \\nconventional DX systems (IPCC, 2005), equivalent to an incremental cost of nearly $32,000 per \\nsupermarket; this capital cost is estimated to be 10% greater in developing countries. Annual savings \\nassociated with reduced refrigerant leakage are estimated to equal almost $2,000 per supermarket. These \\nsystems are assumed to be equally as efficient as DX systems, so no costs or savings are associated with \\nannual energy consumption. \\nIV.2.3.6  \\nNH3 or HCs Secondary Loop and/or Cascade Systems in New Large Retail \\nFood \\nSimilar to the HFC secondary loop and/or cascade option, in this system a secondary fluid is cooled \\nby a primary refrigerant in the machine room and then pumped throughout the store to remove heat \\nfrom the display equipment. In some cases, the secondary loop system is also used in combination with a \\ncascade design, which does not rely on any HFCs in the low temperature circuit. For this abatement \\noption, the primary refrigerant is assumed to be ammonia (NH3) or HCs, which have a GWP that is \\nnegligible. Ammonia is not used in conventional supermarket refrigeration systems because such a \\nsystem could expose consumers to toxic and slightly flammable refrigerant. Similarly, HCs are not used \\ndue to their high flammability. However, using a secondary loop allows the primary refrigerant to be \\nisolated to a mechanical room with controlled access to only those with specific training. Because \\nammonia/HC secondary loop systems avoid running the primary refrigerant through miles of piping to \\nand from food storage cases, they have lower leakage rates than conventional DX systems and operate at \\nreduced charges. In addition, these systems are conservatively assumed to be 5% more energy efficient \\nthan conventional DX systems, with some supermarkets reporting actual efficiency gains of 0.5% to 35% \\n(Wang et al., 2010; SuperValu, 2012; Hydrocarbonconversions.com, 2011). \\nThis abatement option is applied to a newly manufactured large retail food system in a large \\nsupermarket. The one-time cost in developed countries is estimated to be 25% greater than conventional \\nDX systems (IPCC, 2005), equivalent to an incremental cost of roughly $45,600 per supermarket; this \\ncapital cost is estimated to be 10% greater in developing countries. Annual savings are estimated at \\nroughly $5,900 due to both reduced energy consumption and refrigerant savings (due to avoided HFC \\nrefrigerant leaks). In developing countries, where electricity rates are assumed to be higher, annual \\nsavings are assumed to total more than $8,300. \\nIV.2.3.7  \\nCO2 Transcritical Systems in New Large Retail Food \\nThis option eliminates the use of HFCs in large retail food refrigeration systems through the use of \\nCO2 as the primary refrigerant in a transcritical cycle. CO2 transcritical systems are similar to traditional \\ncentralized DX designs but must operate at high pressures to accommodate the low critical temperature \\nof CO2 (GTZ Proklima, 2008). As a result, special controls and component specifications must be \\nincorporated into the system design, which often result in higher upfront costs (USEIA, 2012). \\nAdditionally, CO2 transcritical systems operate most efficiently in cooler climates, performing an \\nestimated 5% to 10% more efficiently than DX systems using an HFC refrigerant in regions with an \\naverage annual temperature below 50\\u00b0F (Supermarket News, 2012).

Specifically, use of these systems is most widely accepted in areas where the maximum ambient \\ntemperature is frequently below 88\\u00b0F (ACHR News, 2010), or where the average annual temperature is \\nlower than 59\\u00b0F (Hill PHOENIX, 2012). Today, it is estimated that over 1,300 CO2 transcritical systems are \\ncurrently in operation in Europe with installations as far south as Italy and Spain in addition to a handful \\nof systems that have been installed in Canada (Shecco, 2012). Plans are also currently underway to deploy \\nthe technology in supermarkets in the United States. \\nThis abatement option is assumed to be applied to a newly manufactured large retail food system in \\nlarge supermarkets in cooler climates. One-time costs in developed countries are estimated to be 17.5% \\nmore expensive than conventional HFC centralized DX systems (Australian Green Cooling Council, 2008; \\nR744.com, 2012), equivalent to an incremental cost of nearly $32,000 per supermarket; these capital costs \\nare estimated to be 10% greater in developing countries. Annual savings are estimated at about $5,900 per \\nsupermarket, which result from both refrigerant savings (due to avoided HFC refrigerant leaks) that total \\napproximately $2,200 per supermarket, and energy savings (due to increased efficiency), which total \\napproximately $3,700 per supermarket. In developing countries, where electricity rates are assumed to be \\nhigher, annual savings are assumed to total more than $8,300. \\nIV.2.3.8 \\nRetrofits of R-404A in Large Retail Food \\nRetail food refrigeration systems containing R-404A, which have high charge sizes and annual leak \\nrates, can be retrofitted with lower-GWP refrigerants, such as R-407A (with a GWP of 1,770), to reduce \\ntheir annual climate impact. While some system retrofits will require little to no change to achieve the \\ndesired operational characteristics, others may need additional modifications, such as changing the \\norifice or TXV size to achieve the same efficiency. If proper system evaluation is performed and \\nconsiderations are taken to ensure the continued reliability of the system, retrofitting can lead to system \\nimprovements as a result of recommissioning the equipment (e.g., due to properly setting up controls \\nand system operating valves, which may have wandered from set-point due to lack of maintenance) \\n(ACHR News, 2012). However, because such changes may have occurred during remodeling, when the \\nrefrigerant retrofit is assumed to occur, no change in energy efficiency due to the new refrigerant is \\nassumed. \\nTo perform a system retrofit, the entire system must be shut down and checks should be made for \\nleaks throughout the system. Solenoid sealings must then be changed as well as the filter driers. After the \\nentire system is evacuated, the replacement fluid is deposited into the system. \\nFor cost modeling purposes, it is assumed that retrofits are performed on large retail food systems at \\nabout half-way through its useful lifetime (i.e., 7 years) at the same time retrofits or remodeling of cases \\nare underway. The original R-404A charge size of 1,633 kg is assumed to be replaced with an equivalent \\namount of R-407A. The procedure is assumed to require 10 hours of a service technician\\u2019s time (5 hours \\nfor the medium temperature system and 5 hours for the low temperature system), all of which is assumed \\nto cost a total of roughly $500 in developed countries and $100 in developing countries (based on \\ntechnician labor rates). Since the composition of R-404A and R-407A are similar, the cost of the refrigerant \\nis assumed to be the same. Therefore, no annual costs or savings are assumed for this option. \\nIV.2.3.9 \\nHCs in New Small Retail Food Refrigeration Systems \\nFor small retail food equipment, this option explores the replacement of HFC-134a and R-404A with \\nHCs. HCs, such as butane and propane, have negligible GWPs.

For example, although R-290 (propane) is flammable, it has been successfully implemented \\nin some self-contained hermetic systems. \\nThis option is applied to a newly manufactured small retail food refrigeration system (e.g., stand\\u00ad\\nalone equipment). No one-time costs are estimated because this option is cost neutral (Unilever, 2008). An \\nannual savings of less than $1 per system is estimated to result from avoided HFC refrigerant costs. \\nIV.2.3.10 \\nHCs in New Window AC and Dehumidifiers \\nR-410A is widely used in window AC units and dehumidifiers, brought about by regulations phasing \\nout HCFC-22, which was previously used. By replacing R-410A with HCs, such as propane (R-290), \\nwhich is assumed to have a negligible GWP, significant emissions can be avoided. Two Chinese AC \\nmanufacturers have already commercialized room AC units using R-290. The R-290 AC designs achieve \\nlower refrigerant charge sizes than is currently required by international standard (IEC 60335-2-240) and \\ninclude additional safety features, such as a special compressor design and refrigerant leak alarm system. \\nMass production of the R-290 units started in 2009, for initial sale in Europe and China (GTZ-Proklima, \\n2009). \\nFor cost modeling purposes, this option is applied to newly manufactured window AC units and \\ndehumidifiers. This option is conservatively assumed to have no one-time costs even though there is \\nindication that R-290 AC units can be produced more cheaply than R-410A units as a result of the better \\nheat transfer properties and lower pressure drop of R-290, which allows for the use of narrower tubes in \\nthe condenser and evaporator (GTZ-Proklima, 2009). Annual savings are estimated based on the reduced \\ncost of HC refrigerant replacement compared with R-410A\\u2014estimated to result in a savings of \\napproximately $0.33 per unit. \\nIV.2.3.11 \\nR-32 in New Unitary AC Equipment and PTAC/PTHP \\nIn this option, R-32,6 a mildly flammable (category 2L in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 34-2010) \\nrefrigerant with a GWP of 650, is used in new unitary AC equipment and PTAC/PTHP to replace R-410A, \\nwhich has a GWP of 1,725. R-32 performs with a reduced charge volume ratio of 66% compared to \\nR-410A (Xu et al., 2012). This reduced charge volume results in a 75% reduction of the direct global \\nwarming impact compared to the R-410A system. It is also reportedly 2% to 3% more energy efficient \\nthan R-410A (Pham and Sachs, 2010). The equipment used also has the potential to be downsized by up \\nto 15%, which can decrease one-time costs by reducing the amount of materials used. R-32 AC products \\nare already available in Japan and are to be launched in India in February 2013 (Daikin, 2012; Stanga, \\n2012). Manufacturers in Algeria, China, Thailand, and Indonesia also plan to transition to R-32 AC \\nsystems (Stanga, 2012). \\nFor cost modeling purposes, this option is applied to a newly manufactured unitary AC system (e.g., \\nresidential, small commercial and large commercial unitary AC) and PTAC/PTHP. The option is \\nconservatively assumed to result in a one-time cost savings of approximately $30 per system, due to the \\nreduced quantity of refrigerant required and lower cost of the alternative refrigerant.

MCHXs are a modification of conventional heat exchangers, which transfer heat in AC and \\nrefrigeration systems (e.g., for the rejection of heat from indoor cooled spaces to the outside ambient \\nspace). Because MCHXs transfer heat through a series of small tubes instead of a single or multiple large-\\ndiameter tubes, systems using them require between 35% and 40% less refrigerant to operate than those \\nusing conventional heat exchangers. Likewise, if average leak rates remain the same,7 the actual amount \\nof refrigerant emitted would be less. In addition, MCHX systems perform better and are more energy \\nefficient than conventional systems. They also require smaller components, which results in reduced \\nquantities of metals and other materials required per unit, although potential savings in material costs are \\nnot analyzed here. MCHXs are already used widely by multiple manufacturers in the automotive \\nindustry and in certain models of screw and scroll chillers. \\nFor cost modeling purposes, this option is applied to a newly manufactured unitary AC system (e.g., \\nresidential, small commercial, and large commercial unitary AC). One-time savings equal to roughly $27 \\nare assumed due to the smaller refrigerant charge. No annual costs are assumed for this option. The \\nannual savings associated with avoided refrigerant losses is estimated at approximately $2.30 per system. \\nIV.2.3.13 \\nR-32 with MCHX in New Unitary AC Equipment \\nSimilar to the option described above, this option explores the use of MCHX in unitary AC \\nequipment but with R-32 refrigerant (with a GWP of 650) in place of R-410A (with a GWP of 1,725). The \\nuse of the MCHX results in a refrigerant charge reduction of between 35% and 40% compared with \\nconventional heat exchangers, while the use of R-32 refrigerant allows a further charge size reduction of \\n66% compared with R-410A. Combined, the reduced charge volume and GWP lead to a lower global \\nwarming impact of approximately 85%. \\nFor cost modeling purposes, this option is applied to a newly manufactured unitary AC system (e.g., \\nresidential, small commercial, and large commercial unitary AC). One-time savings equal to roughly $46 \\nare assumed as a result of the smaller refrigerant charge and lower cost of the alternative refrigerant. No \\nannual costs are assumed for this option.

The annual savings associated with avoided refrigerant losses is \\nestimated at approximately $50 per chiller. \\nIV.2.3.15 \\nNH3 or CO2 in New IPR and Cold Storage Systems \\nThis abatement option is assumed to be applicable to cold storage and industrial process refrigeration \\nsystems. Although NH3 refrigeration systems are already common in refrigerated spaces over 200,000 sq. \\nft., additional penetration of NH3 systems is possible in facilities that are less than 200,000 sq. ft. but \\ngreater than 50,000 sq. ft. In addition, modern NH3 absorption refrigeration units are compact, \\nlightweight, efficient, economical, and safe, which has made more applications possible. Improved \\ntechnologies have also expanded the technical feasibility of using CO2 systems. CO2 systems are being \\nused in low-temperature refrigeration (\\u221230\\u00b0C to \\u221256\\u00b0C), while ammonia/CO2 systems can be used for \\nhigher temperature refrigeration (\\u221235\\u00b0C to \\u221254\\u00b0C). The lower temperature for both systems is limited \\nprimarily by the \\u221256\\u00b0C triple point of CO2 being used on the low side. The choice between these systems \\nis primarily due to outdoor temperatures; in colder climates, a CO2 system is both energy efficient and \\nsimpler, while in hotter climates a cascade system may be needed to maintain energy efficiency. In \\nEurope and the United States, storage and production facilities have been built with ammonia/CO2 \\ncascade systems. These systems are estimated to be 2% to 20% more energy efficient compared with their \\nHFC counterparts (Gooseff and Horton, 2008). \\nFor cost modeling purposes, this option is applied to a newly constructed IPR/cold storage \\nrefrigeration system/facility. The incremental one-time cost is estimated at approximately $210,700 per \\nsystem in developed countries (Gooseff and Horton, 2008), assumed to be 10% more in developing \\ncountries. The annual savings of approximately $50,300 per system is associated with lower refrigerant \\nreplacement costs and reduced energy consumption of 11%; annual electricity cost savings are assumed \\nto be 66% greater for developing countries, resulting in annual savings of approximately $83,100. \\nIV.2.3.16 \\nRefrigerant Recovery at Disposal for All Existing Equipment Types \\nSome level of refrigerant recovery at equipment disposal already occurs in the baseline of developed \\nand developing countries, because it is illegal to vent HFCs when equipment is discarded in the U.S. and \\nelsewhere. However, this option explores more widespread, thorough efforts to recover refrigerant at \\ndisposal across all equipment types. The approach involves using a refrigerant recovery device that \\ntransfers refrigerant into an external storage container prior to disposal of the equipment. Once the \\nrecovery process is complete, the refrigerant contained in the storage container may be cleaned by using \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-31 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING \\nrecycling devices, sent to a reclamation facility to be purified,8 or destroyed using approved technologies \\n(e.g., incineration). \\nFor cost modeling purposes, this option is applied to an auto dismantling facility assumed to use a \\nsingle refrigerant recovery device that meets SAE J2788 standards to perform MVAC recovery jobs. The \\nincremental one-time cost is estimated at approximately $2,025 per facility for the purchase of a \\nrefrigerant recovery device in developed countries (ICF, 2008); this cost is estimated to be 10% greater in \\ndeveloping countries. Annual costs are estimated at roughly $1,100 per auto dismantling facility for \\ntechnician labor time and the purchase of new filters for the recovery device (ICF, 2008). In developing \\ncountries, technician labor costs are assumed to be one-fifth the cost of that in developed countries; \\ntherefore, annual costs are assumed to be about $240. The annual savings is estimated at about $440 per \\nauto dismantling facility, based on the value of the recovered refrigerant for reclamation/reuse. \\nIV.2.3.17 \\nRefrigerant Recovery at Servicing for Existing Small Equipment \\nSimilar to disposal recovery, this option assumes more widespread and thorough refrigerant \\nrecovery practices while servicing HFC refrigeration/AC systems. Because it is assumed that significant \\nrefrigerant is already recovered during servicing of large equipment, this abatement option is only \\napplied to MVAC and small unitary AC systems. \\nFor cost modeling purposes, this option is applied to a U.S. auto servicing facility assumed to \\nperform MVAC servicing jobs using a recovery/recycling (recharge) device designed to meet the SAE \\nJ2788 standard. The incremental one-time cost is estimated at approximately $4,050 per servicing facility \\nfor the purchase of a refrigerant recovery device in developed countries (ICF, 2008); this cost is estimated \\nto be 10% greater in developing countries. The annual cost is estimated at roughly $870 per auto servicing \\nfacility in developed countries for technician labor time and the purchase of new filters for the recovery \\ndevice (ICF, 2008); in developing countries, technician labor costs are assumed to be one-fifth the cost of \\nthat in developed countries; therefore, the annual cost is assumed to be nearly $194. The annual savings is \\nestimated at roughly $350 per auto servicing facility, based on the value of the recovered refrigerant for \\nreclamation/reuse. \\nIV.2.3.18 \\nLeak Repair for Existing Large Equipment \\nThis abatement option is assumed to be applicable to large retail food, cold storage and industrial \\nrefrigeration, and positive displacement chiller systems. Some level of leak repair activity is already \\npracticed in the baseline, but this option explores additional efforts to repair leaks. \\nFor cost modeling purposes, this option is applied to large supermarkets requiring significant small \\nrepairs (e.g., maintenance of the purge system or replacement of a gasket or \\u041e-ring). A one-time cost of \\napproximately $1,870 is estimated per supermarket for parts and labor needed to perform the repair in \\ndeveloped countries (USEPA, 1998); in developing countries, this cost is estimated to be 10% greater. The \\nannual savings associated with avoided refrigerant replacement is estimated at $1,470 per supermarket. \\n8 Recycling cleans and reclamation purifies recovered refrigerant; reclamation is more thorough and involves \\nrepeated precision distillation, filtering, and contaminant removal. Recycling is used for on-site servicing of MVACs \\nand other equipment, whereas reclamation requires sending the refrigerant off-site to a reclaimer. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-32 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING \\nIV.2.3.19 \\nHCs in New Domestic Refrigeration Systems \\nHFC-134a may be replaced with HCs in household refrigerators. HCs, such as butane and propane, \\nhave very low GWPs of 4.0 and 3.3, respectively. The main disadvantage of HCs is that they are \\nflammable, but engineering design changes and safety features in manufacturing plants have been \\nsuccessfully implemented to overcome these challenges. In 2009, roughly 40% of new household \\nrefrigerators/freezers produced globally contained HCs, with more than 400 million HC units in use \\nworldwide (Greenpeace, 2009). This option is not quantitatively assessed in this analysis but will be \\nconsidered for future updates. \\nIV.2.3.20 \\nCO2 in Transport Refrigeration \\nCO2 is currently being used in trucks in cryogenic (open-loop) systems and is also viable for use in \\nrefrigerated ships and intermodal containers using a compressor system (Carrier, 2013; Environmental \\nLeader, 2010). However, more sophisticated refrigeration cycles are needed for CO2 systems to match the \\nefficiency of equivalent HFC units under high ambient temperature operation. The cycle operation is \\noften transcritical, which results in compressor discharge pressures up to five times higher than \\nconventional HFC systems. Therefore, entirely new parts, design approaches, test procedures, service \\ntraining, etc. are needed to design, build and operate a trans-critical CO2 system (TEAP, 2011). Due to a \\nlack of readily available cost information on this alternative, this option is not quantitatively assessed in \\nthis analysis. \\nIV.2.3.21 \\nLow-GWP Refrigerants and Blends \\nSignificant research and development (R&D) efforts are underway to identify feasible alternatives for \\nhigh-GWP HFC refrigerants in multiple subsectors. For instance, the U.S. EPA\\u2019s Significant New \\nAlternatives Policy (SNAP) program has found - 1233zd(E) (also called trans-1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop\\u00ad\\n1-ene) and HFO-1234ze(E) acceptable for use in chillers, used mainly for comfort AC in large residential \\nand commercial buildings, including facilities with data processing and communication centers. Potential \\nalternatives in numerous refrigeration and AC uses include ammonia, hydrocarbons, CO2, water, HFC\\u00ad\\n32, and new low-GWP refrigerants such as HFO-1234yf, HFO-1234ze, -1233zd(E), and blends containing \\nHFOs. The Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) launched the Low-GWP \\nAlternative Refrigerants Evaluation Program to evaluate low-GWP alternatives to HCFC-22, HFC-134a, \\nR-404A, R-407C, and R-410A in various product types (AHRI, 2013). Some 40 chemicals were identified, \\nincluding refrigerants or blends with no, low, and high flammability. The GWPs of these products also \\nvaried, from zero to about 1,300. Some of these blends are under intense development and testing and are \\nmost commonly known by trade names, including DR-5, DR-7, DR-33, L-20, L-40, L-41, N-13, N-40, and \\nXP-10. Because of a lack of readily available cost information on this alternative, these options are not \\nquantitatively assessed in this analysis. \\nIV.2.4 \\nEngineering Cost Data Summary \\nTable 2-3

the above representative project costs for model facilities in the United \\nStates, developed countries, and developing countries. We applied the costs to calculate the break-even \\nprices for each appropriate option for each country. The model estimates the mitigation potential based \\non the percentage of the total ODS substitutes\\u2019 baseline (that is, the HFC emissions from the traditional \\nODS industries) attributable to each representative type of equipment and the technical effectiveness for \\neach technology in each facility or system. \\nIV.2.5.2 \\nAssessment of Technical Effectiveness \\nThe analysis also developed a technical effectiveness parameter, defined as the percentage reductions \\nachievable by each technology/region/equipment type combination. Estimating this parameter requires \\nmaking a number of assumptions regarding the distribution of emissions by facility in addition to \\nprocess-specific estimates of technical applicability and market penetration. Market penetration rates \\nvary over time as systems are upgraded; market penetration is a modeled value that accounts for a \\nnumber of elements, such as market choice, the turnover rate to replace existing banks of equipment that \\nuse HFCs, and the lifetime of refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment. Technical effectiveness \\nfigures do not account for indirect GHG impacts (i.e., increases or decreases in electricity or fuel \\nconsumption), which are accounted for in the cost analysis.9 Table 2-4 summarizes these assumptions and \\npresents technical effectiveness parameters used in the MAC model. \\nTable 2-4: \\nTechnical Effectiveness Summary \\nFacility/Abatement Option  \\nTechnical  \\nApplicability  \\nMarket  \\nPenetration  \\nRate (2030)a  \\nReduction \\nEfficiency  \\nMVACs  \\u2013  U.S./Other Developed  \\nEnhanced HFC-134a  \\nNew  systems  \\n0%  \\n50%  \\n0%  \\nHFO-1234yf  \\n0%  \\n99.7%  \\n36%  \\nEnhanced HFO-1234yf   \\n100%  \\n99.8%  \\n64%  \\nMVACs  \\u2013  EU  \\nEnhanced HFC-134a  \\nNew  systems  \\n0%  \\n50%  \\n0%  \\nHFO-1234yf  \\n0%  \\n99.7%  \\n0%  \\nEnhanced HFO-1234yf  \\n100%  \\n99.8%  \\n32%  \\nTechnical  \\nEffectiveness  \\n(2030)b  \\n(continued) \\n9 Indirect GHG emissions are not accounted for in the technical effectiveness calculations so that the analysis can \\nshow purely ODS substitute (e.g., HFC) emission reductions achievable. While it is recognized that indirect GHG \\nemissions can be significant, the incremental differences of the options considered here compared to traditional HFC \\nsystems are expected to be relatively small. Such differences, to the extent data is available on such, are accounted for \\nin the cost analyses. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-36 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING \\nTable 2-4: \\nTechnical Effectiveness Summary (continued) \\nMVACs  \\u2013Developing  \\nEnhanced HFC-134a  \\n \\nHFO-1234yf \\nNew  systems  \\n0%  \\n50%  \\n4%  \\n100%  \\n99.7%  \\n44%  \\nEnhanced HFO-1234yf  \\n0%  \\n99.8%  \\n0%  \\nLarge Retail Food \\u2013  U.S./Other Developed  \\nDistributed systems  \\nNew systems  \\n10%  \\n80%  \\n17%  \\nHFC secondary loop and/or cascade  systems  \\n50%  \\n95%  \\n28%  \\nNH3  or HC secondary loop and/or cascade  systems  \\n20%  \\n100%  \\n13%  \\nCO2  transcritical systems  \\n20%  \\n100%  \\n19%  \\nRetrofits  of R-404A  \\nR-404A  systems  at or  \\nbeyond average age  \\n100%  \\n46%  \\n1%  \\nLarge Retail Food \\u2013  EU  \\nDistributed systems  \\nNew systems  \\n0%  \\n80%  \\n10%  \\nHFC secondary loop and/or cascade  systems  \\n0% \\n95%  \\n16%  \\nNH3  or HC secondary loop and/or cascade  systems  \\n35%  \\n100%  \\n21%  \\nCO2  transcritical systems  \\n60%  \\n100%  \\n47%  \\nRetrofits of R-404A  \\nR-404A systems at or  \\nbeyond average age  \\n100%  \\n46%  \\n1%  \\nLarge Retail Food \\u2013  Developing  \\nDistributed systems \\nNew systems   \\n30%  \\n80%  \\n15%  \\nHFC secondary loop and/or cascade  systems  \\n37%  \\n95%  \\n16%  \\nNH3  or HC secondary loop and/or cascade  systems \\n13%  \\n100%  \\n4%  \\nCO2  transcritical systems  \\n20%  \\n100%  \\n8%  \\nRetrofits of R-404A  \\nR-404A systems  at or  \\nbeyond average age  \\n100%  \\n46%  \\n3%  \\nSmall Retail Food \\u2013  U.S./Other Developed  \\nHCs  \\nNew systems  \\n100%  \\n100%  \\n68%  \\nSmall Retail Food \\u2013  EU  \\nHCs  \\nNew systems  \\n100% \\n100%  \\n62%  \\nSmall Retail Food \\u2013  Developing  \\nHCs  \\nNew systems  \\n100%  \\n100%  \\n27%  \\nWindow AC Units and Dehumidifiers  \\u2013  U.S./Other Developed  \\nHCs   \\nNew systems  \\n34%  \\n100%  \\n3%  \\nWindow AC Units and Dehumidifiers  \\u2013  EU  \\nHCs  \\nNew  systems  \\n50%  \\n100%  \\n3%  \\nFacility/Abatement  Option \\nTechnical  \\nApplicability  \\nMarket  \\nPenetration  \\nRate (2030)a  \\nReduction \\nEfficiency  \\nTechnical  \\nEffectiveness \\n(2030)b  \\n(continued) \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-37 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING \\nTable 2-4: \\nTechnical Effectiveness Summary (continued) \\nFacility/Abatement Option  \\nTechnical  \\nApplicability  \\nMarket  \\nPenetration  \\nRate (2030)a  \\nReduction \\nEfficiency  \\nWindow AC Units and Dehumidifiers  \\u2013  Developing  \\nHCs   \\nNew systems  \\n50%  \\n100%  \\n3%  \\nPTAC/PTHP  -

is 208 and 994 MtCO2e, respectively. There are 479 \\nMtCO2e of emissions reductions available in 2030 from implementing currently available technologies \\nthat are cost-effective at projected costs. If an additional emissions reduction value (e.g., tax incentive, \\nsubsidy, or tradable emissions reduction credit) above the zero break-even price were available to users \\nor manufacturers of refrigeration and AC systems, then additional emission reductions could be cost-\\neffective.

Thus, the costs and \\nreduction efficiencies of the alternatives reviewed in this analysis are subject to change and likely very \\nconservative. Moreover, new options not quantified in this analysis are entering the market and will \\ncontinue to do so; additional options, such as HCs in domestic refrigerators, CO2 in transport \\nrefrigeration, and low-GWP refrigerants for comfort cooling chillers, could be quantitatively considered \\nin future analyses. \\nIn addition, the costs for the options explored in this analysis are highly variable, depending on the \\ntypes of systems reviewed. In particular, estimates of the amount of refrigerant recoverable from \\nequipment at service and disposal are highly uncertain and highly variable based on the type of \\nequipment. Recovery from large equipment is generally more cost-effective than for small equipment, \\nbecause the amount of refrigerant recoverable is greater and the relative amount of technician time \\nneeded to perform the recovery is smaller. Similarly, because leak repair can be performed on many \\ndifferent equipment types and can involve many different activities/tools, it is difficult to determine an \\naverage cost of such repairs or the average emission reduction associated with them. This analysis, \\ntherefore, relies on broad assumptions available in the published literature, which may not reflect specific \\nor even average values for the leak repair activities modeled. \\nFinally, it is assumed that numerous abatement options result in increased or decreased energy \\nconsumption (e.g., enhanced HFO-1234yf or HFC-134a in MVACs, CO2 transcritical large retail food \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-42 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING \\nrefrigeration systems, distributed refrigeration systems, NH3 or CO2 in new IPR and cold storage \\nsystems). While the costs associated with the increase or decrease in energy consumption, which would \\nvary widely based on region as well as particular application, is quantified as part of this analysis, the \\nincrease or decrease in CO2 emissions associated with this energy use is not quantified. To accurately \\ncapture net emission reductions of these abatement options, emissions associated with the increase or \\ndecrease in energy use should also be calculated. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-43 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING \\nReferences  \\n3M. 2008.

HFC Emissions from Solvent Use \\nIV.3.1 \\nSector Summary  \\nH\\nistorically, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) (in particular CFC-113), methyl chloroform, and, to a \\nlesser extent, carbon tetrachloride were used as the predominant solvent cleaning agents. \\nHydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), hydrofluoroethers (HFEs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and \\naqueous and semi-aqueous not-in-kind (NIK) solvents have since replaced these historical solvents, with \\nHFC emissions currently dominating the global warming potential (GWP)-weighted emissions from the \\nsolvents sector. \\nGreenhouse gas emissions from the solvents sector (excluding CFCs and HCFCs) were estimated at \\nroughly 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e.) in 2010. By 2030, emissions from \\nthis sector are expected to more than double, reaching over 10 MtCO2e. A majority of the growth will \\nresult from increased use of HFCs in developing countries. Figure 3-1 presents the HFC and PFC baseline \\nemissions from solvent use between 2000 and 2030. \\nSource: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), 2012a \\nFour abatement options were identified for the solvent sector: (1) replacement of HFCs with HFEs, \\n(2) retrofitting of equipment, (3) transition to NIK aqueous, and (4) transition to NIK semi-aqueous. \\nThe global abatement potential is equal to approximately 58.9% of total annual emissions from the \\nsolvent sector and 0.3% of total annual emissions from all sectors that use ODS substitutes. These results \\nare partly due to the assumed adoption of HFEs which, although they have a relatively lower GWP than \\nHFCs, still result in emissions of greenhouse gases. In the same way, the adoption of equipment retrofits, \\nanother abatement option, still results in emissions of greenhouse gases. Finally, it is assumed that due to \\nthe performance limitations of the available alternatives, in the absence of policy measures, a portion of \\nthe market will not make the transition away from HFCs. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-49 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 3-2: \\nGlobal Abatement Potential in Solvent Use: 2010, 2020, and 2030 \\n-$30 \\n-$20 \\n-$10 \\n$0 \\n$10 \\n$20 \\n$30 \\n$40 \\n$50 \\n$60 \\n0 \\n1 \\n2 \\n3 \\n4 \\n5 \\n$/tCO2e \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n6 \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM SOLVENT USE \\nMarginal abatement cost (MAC) curve results are presented in Figure 3-2. Maximum abatement \\npotential in the solvents sector is 5.7 MtCO2e in 2030. There are 4.8 MtCO2e of emissions reductions in \\n2030 that are cost-effective (i.e., $0/tCO2e or lower abatement cost) at currently projected energy prices. \\nIV.3.2 \\nEmissions from Solvents  \\nAlthough solvents are primarily an emissive use, emissions from solvent applications are not equal to \\nthe amount of solvent consumed in a year because a portion of used solvent remains in the liquid phase \\nand is not emitted as gas during use. However, as the solvent is continuously reused through a distilling \\nand cleaning process or through recycling, it is assumed that eventually approximately 90% of the solvent \\nconsumed in a given year is emitted, while 10% of solvent is disposed of with the sludge that remains. \\nFor the purpose of this analysis, the sector is characterized by precision cleaning applications and \\nelectronics cleaning applications. Precision cleaning requires a high level of cleanliness to ensure the \\nsatisfactory performance of the product being cleaned, and electronics cleaning is defined as a process \\nthat removes contaminants, primarily solder flux residues, from electronics or circuit boards. To develop \\nthe cost analysis, the model vapor degreaser is assumed to be 10 square feet in size, uses HFC-4310mee as \\na solvent, and emits 250 to 500 pounds of solvent annually, depending on whether the equipment has \\nbeen retrofitted. Figure 3-3 presents the global distribution of HFC and PFC emissions from solvent use in \\n2020 by degreaser type. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-50 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 3-3: \\nGlobal HFC Emissions in 2020 by Degreaser Type (% of GWP-Weighted Emissions) \\nRetrofitted \\nPrecision \\nCleaning, 36% \\nNon-retrofitted \\nPrecision \\nCleaning, 21% \\nRetrofitted \\nElectronic \\nCleaning, 27% \\nNon-retrofitted \\nElectronic \\nCleaning, 16% \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM SOLVENT USE \\nIV.3.2.1 \\nActivity Data or Important Sectoral or Regional Trends \\nSolvent consumption, which is estimated using USEPA\\u2019s Vintaging Model for the United States, is \\nused to represent activity data. Solvent consumption is scaled according to country gross domestic \\nproduct. Solvent emissions are directly correlated with solvent consumption; it is assumed that almost all \\n(90%) of the solvent consumed in a given year is emitted. There are no regional differences in assumed \\nemissions rates. \\nIn developed countries, retrofits are assumed to have already been fully adopted, and in developing \\ncountries all equipment is assumed to remain nonretrofitted. In addition, although NIK replacement \\nalternatives and HFE solvent applications currently exist worldwide, the baseline emissions considered \\nhere only covers that portion of the market still using HFCs and PFCs. Hence, for the purposes of \\ntransitioning away from the high GWP solvents in this analysis, there is no technology adoption of the \\nNIK and HFE solvents in the baseline. \\nIV.3.2.2 \\nEmission Estimates and Related Assumptions \\nGlobal emissions of HFCs from the solvents sector were 5 MtCO2e in 2010, growing to 10 MtCO2e in \\n2030. Table 3-1 presents the projected emissions for solvents use by country and regions between 2010 \\nand 2030. All emissions are the result of HFC-4310mee consumption.1 Emissions are projected to grow \\nsignificantly as developing country economies grow and demand for such solvents grows. Emissions \\nwere estimated based on assumptions about initial market size of the sector, the specific transitions away \\nfrom CFCs and other ODSs in terms of timing and alternative solvent used, charge sizes, and leak rates, \\nusing the Vintaging Model. \\n1 PFC solvent use in precision cleaning end-uses is assumed to discontinue such that no emissions of PFCs are \\nprojected beyond 2010 from this sector. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-51 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM SOLVENT USE \\nTable 3-1: \\nProjected Baseline Emissions from Solvent Use: 2010\\u20132030 (MtCO2e) \\nCountry/Region  \\n2010  \\n2015 \\n2020 \\n2025 \\n2030 \\nTop 5  Emitting Countries  \\nChina  \\n0.7  \\n1.0  \\n1.4  \\n2.0  \\n2.7  \\n6.9%  \\nUnited States  \\n1.3  \\n1.5  \\n1.6  \\n1.8  \\n2.0  \\n2.0%  \\nJapan  \\n0.9  \\n1.0  \\n1.0  \\n1.1  \\n1.2  \\n1.2%  \\nRussia  \\n0.4  \\n0.4  \\n0.5  \\n0.7  \\n0.8  \\n4.2%  \\nSouth Korea  \\n0.2  \\n0.2  \\n0.2  \\n0.3  \\n0.3  \\n3.5%  \\nRest of Regions  \\nAfrica  \\n0.1  \\n0.1  \\n0.1  \\n0.1  \\n0.2  \\n3.9%  \\nCentral & South America  \\n0.2  \\n0.2  \\n0.2  \\n0.3  \\n0.3  \\n3.3%  \\nMiddle East  \\n0.0  \\n0.0  \\n0.0  \\n0.1  \\n0.1  \\n3.8%  \\nEurope  \\n1.1  \\n1.1  \\n1.2  \\n1.3  \\n1.4  \\n1.2%  \\nEurasia  \\n0.0  \\n0.0  \\n0.0  \\n0.0  \\n0.0  \\n4.2%  \\nAsia \\n0.2 \\n0.3 \\n0.3 \\n0.4 \\n0.5 \\n4.2% \\nNorth America \\n0.2  \\n0.2  \\n0.2  \\n0.3  \\n0.3  \\n2.5%  \\nWorld Total \\n5.2 \\n6.0 \\n7.0 \\n8.2 \\n9.7 \\n3.1% \\nCAGRa  \\n(2010\\u20132030)  \\na CAGR = Compound Annual Growth Rate \\nSource:  USEPA, 2012a  \\nIV.3.3 \\nAbatement Measures and Engineering Cost Analysis \\nA total of four abatement options were identified and analyzed for the solvent sector: (1) replacement \\nof HFCs with HFEs, (2) retrofitting of equipment, (3) transition to NIK aqueous, and (4) transition to NIK \\nsemi-aqueous.

Although other low-GWP chemicals may be feasible, HFE-7100 \\nand HFE-7200 are used as proxies for this abatement option because they display material compatibility \\nproperties similar to HFCs, a prime factor that has led to their success in the market. To model emission \\nreductions, this option assumes that the degreaser transitions to the use of 75% HFE-7100 and 25% HFE\\u00ad\\n7200.2 For the purpose of this analysis, the 100-year GWP of alternative solvents is calculated as the \\nweighted average of 75% HFE-7100, with a GWP of 390, and 25% HFE-7200, with a GWP of 55, for a GWP \\nof 306.25. The GWP of the solvent being replaced, HFC-4310mee, is 1,300;3 thus, this option has a \\nreduction efficiency of 76.4%. \\nCosts associated with the conversion to HFE solvents are assumed to be negligible because of \\nsimilarities in key chemical properties of HFE solvents and HFC-4310mee, as well as similar pricing \\nstructures. \\nIV.3.3.2 \\nRetrofit \\nThis abatement option is applicable to nonretrofitted facilities using solvents for the purpose of \\nprecision cleaning and electronics cleaning. Retrofits, including engineering control changes (e.g., \\nincreased freeboard height, installation of freeboard chillers, and use of automatic hoists), improved \\ncontainment, and implementation of other abatement technologies can reduce emissions of HFCs used in \\nsolvent cleaning. Retrofitting a vapor degreaser, combined with proper operation and maintenance, can \\nreduce solvent emissions from 46% to as much as 70%, depending on the specific retrofit methods chosen \\n(Durkee, 1997). For example, installing a freeboard refrigeration device, sometimes referred to as a chiller \\n(i.e., a set of secondary coils mounted in the freeboard), and maintaining a freeboard ratio of 1.0 to \\nminimize diffusional solvent losses, can reduce emissions by 46%, while installing heating coils to \\nproduce superheated vapor along with installing a chiller can reduce emissions by 70%. For the purpose \\nof this analysis, the reduction efficiency of the retrofit option is assumed to equal 50%. \\nIn the United States, many enterprises have bought new equipment or retrofitted aging equipment \\ninto compliance with the National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), which \\nlimits emissions from degreasers using traditional chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene. \\nFluorinated solvents such as HFCs are not covered by this regulation; nonetheless, a number of \\ncompanies using HFCs and other nonchlorinated solvents have adopted NESHAP-compliant solvent \\ncleaning machines because of the associated economic, occupational, and environmental benefits (i.e., \\nreduced emissions) (Durkee, 1997). Likewise, many European countries have imposed stringent \\nenvironmental and safety regulations that require the lowest level of emissions attainable by solvent \\ndegreasing equipment. Retrofit techniques were either already implemented or simply not required if the \\nuser had purchased new emission-tight vapor degreasers. Consequently, this analysis assumes that end \\n2 In actuality, a facility would choose one of the two HFEs for adoption; however, for modeling purposes this \\nassumption was used to reflect the market presence of the two HFEs. \\n3 Although the GWP value for HFC-4310mee was taken from the IPCC Second Assessment Report (1996), the report did \\nnot provide GWP values for either HFE. Consequently, this analysis uses the GWP values listed in the IPCC Third \\nAssessment Report (2001) for both HFEs. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-53 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM SOLVENT USE \\nusers in the United States and developed countries have already adopted these controls and that any \\nemissions from these facilities cannot be further abated by this option. In contrast, solvent users in non-\\nAnnex I (i.e., developing) countries are assumed to not have retrofitted their equipment but may consider \\nthe equipment retrofit option, because updating their equipment may be preferred over investing in \\nentirely new units. \\nCosts associated with adopting improved equipment and cleaning processes using existing solvents \\n(retrofit) are incurred during the retrofit process and are estimated at $24,500 per degreaser. Annual \\nsavings of $4,500 are also realized through the avoided consumption of HFC that results from a reduction \\nin emissions. \\nIV.3.3.3 \\nNot-in-Kind Aqueous \\nThis abatement option is applicable only to facilities that use solvents for the purposes of electronics \\ncleaning. This option replaces HFC-containing systems used for electronic cleaning end uses with an \\naqueous cleaning process. In the aqueous process, a water-based cleaning solution is used as the primary \\nsolvent and is usually combined with a detergent to remove contaminants. Because all HFCs are replaced \\nwith a solvent that does not have a GWP, the reduction efficiency of this option is 100%. \\nCosts associated with adopting an aqueous NIK replacement alternative are assumed to be $50,000 \\nfor the initial investment and $7,400 annually due to energy and water consumption costs. However, \\nannual savings are also assumed to result from not using an HFC-based cleaner; savings are estimated to \\nrange from $6,700 to $11,200 depending on whether the solvent-based cleaning system had been \\nretrofitted, which will significantly offset annual costs. \\nIV.3.3.4 \\nNot-in-Kind Semi-aqueous \\nThis abatement option is applicable only to facilities that use solvents for the purposes of electronics \\ncleaning. This option replaces HFC-containing systems used for electronic cleaning end uses with a semi-\\naqueous cleaning process. In the semi-aqueous process, the cleaning solution is an organic solvent that is \\nblended with a surfactant, making it water soluble. An example of a solvent/surfactant blend is a \\nterpene/water combination blended with glycol ethers. Because all HFCs are replaced with solvents that \\nhave no GWP, the reduction efficiency is 100%. \\nCosts associated with adopting a semi-aqueous NIK replacement alternative are assumed to be \\n$55,000 for the initial investment and $9,100 annually due to energy and water consumption costs.4 \\nAnnual savings are also assumed to result from not using an HFC-based cleaner; savings are estimated to \\nrange from $6,700 to $11,200 depending on whether the solvent-based cleaning system had been \\nretrofitted. \\nIV.3.3.5 \\nLow-GWP Alternatives \\nTwo low-GWP alternatives, perfluorobutyl iodide (PFBI) and Solstice 1233zd(E), are also emerging \\noptions.

Solstice 1233zd(E) is part of a new class of solvents specifically designed with a low \\natmospheric lifetime, ODP, and GWP, making it a candidate to replace high GWP HFCs and low or \\nmoderate GWP HFE solvents, as well as saturated HCFCs in solvent cleaning applications (UNEP, 2012). \\nIt has a GWP of 4.7 to 7 (USEPA, 2012b) and is nonflammable, making it an attractive option for some \\nmarkets. The United States is completing its evaluation of whether it can be considered acceptable for use \\nin electronics, precision, and metals cleaning. \\nPFBI also has a low GWP of 5. In 2012, PFBI was listed by the US Significant New Alternatives Policy \\n(SNAP) program as acceptable for use in electronics, metal, and precision cleaning (USEPA, 2012c). This \\nsubstance may be feasible for the cleaning oxygen systems in the aerospace industry as a potential \\nreplacement for HCFC-225ca/cb because of its good cleaning performance (Mitchell and Lowrey, 2012); \\nhowever, it is unclear the extent to which this solvent will be used in place of HCFCs as well as HFC and \\nHFE solvents. \\nGiven the low GWP of these and similar options under development, we could expect emission \\nreductions to be similar to the NIK aqueous and semi-aqueous options under the same market \\npenetration assumptions. However, because these chemicals can also compete with HFEs with mid-range \\nGWPs and could avoid the energy and water consumption barriers seen with the NIK options, market \\npenetration may be further or faster than the options analyzed here. \\nIV.3.3.6 \\nEngineering Cost Data Summary \\nTable 3-3 presents the engineering cost data for each mitigation option outlined above, including all \\ncost parameters necessary to calculate the break-even price.

This is a very simplistic assumption that \\nmay not adequately reflect regional differences in the adoption of retrofitted equipment. Additionally, the \\nreductions associated with adopting retrofitted equipment are based on older sources that may no longer \\nbe applicable to the current market. Further research in this area is needed to refine both baseline \\nestimates and the reduction potential associated with retrofits. \\nAnother area of uncertainty in this analysis is related to how costs for the mitigation technologies \\nmay vary internationally. The analysis is currently limited due to the lack of region-specific cost \\ninformation. \\nAlso, it is assumed that the aqueous and semi-aqueous abatement options result in increased energy \\nconsumption (3M, 2008); however, the increase in CO2 emissions associated with this energy use is not \\nquantified as part of this analysis. To accurately capture net emission reductions of these abatement \\noptions, emissions associated with the increased energy use should also be calculated. \\nFinally, low-GWP alternatives for use in solvent applications are still emerging onto the market and \\ncould potentially replace HFCs and HFEs, further reducing projected emissions once adopted. This \\nanalysis does not project further abatement that can occur because of these alternatives as information on \\ntheir potential uptake by the market and associated transition costs is unknown at this time. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-58 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM SOLVENT USE \\nReferences  \\n3M. 2008. \\u201cAdvantages of Solvent vs. Aqueous Cleaning.\\u201d Electronic Market Materials Division. \\nAvailable \\nat: \\nhttp://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Novec/Home/Product_Information/ \\nEngineered_Fluids/. \\n3M Performance Materials.

HFC Emissions from Foams Manufacturing \\nIV.4.1 \\nSector Summary  \\nF \\noam is used as insulation in a range of equipment and products, including refrigerated  \\nappliances, reefers and other refrigerated transport systems, in buildings (e.g., walls, roofs,  \\nfloors) and pipes, and to produce other products, such as steering wheels, furniture, and shoes,  \\nfor example. A wide variety of foam types are used for these applications, which have historically been  \\nproduced with blowing agents that are ozone-depleting substances (i.e., chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and  \\nhydrochlorofluorocarbons [HCFCs]), but since the ODS phaseout under the Montreal Protocol, HFCs  \\nhave commonly been adopted in their place\\u2014primarily HFC-134a, HFC-152a, HFC-245fa, and HFC\\u00ad\\n365mfc. Greenhouse gas emissions from the foams sector (excluding CFCs and HCFCs) were estimated at  \\nroughly 22 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2010. By 2020, emissions  \\nfrom this sector are expected to reach over 52 MtCO2e, as shown in Figure 4-1.  \\nFigure 4-1: \\nHFC Emissions from Foams Manufacturing: 2000\\u20132030 (MtCO2e) \\nSource: USEPA, 2012a. \\nThis analysis reviews options to reduce emissions from the foams sector by using low-global \\nwarming potential (GWP) foam-blowing agents in lieu of HFCs in new equipment/products and by \\nrecovering and destroying foam-blowing agents from household refrigerators at the end of the \\nequipment\\u2019s life. \\nGlobal abatement potential from the options reviewed equates to approximately 40.3% of total \\nannual foam sector emissions and 21.9% of total emissions from ODS substitutes in 2030. While many \\noptions have been analyzed that can completely replace the HFC blowing agent in foams, abatement in \\nthe foams sector is limited by the lifetime of the installed base of foam products; all abatement \\nopportunities analyzed replace the blowing agent in newly manufactured foams only, or destroy the \\nblowing agent only at the foam natural end of life. Marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve results are \\npresented in Figure 4-2. Maximum abatement potential in the foams sector is 37.0 MtCO2e in 2030. There \\nare 27 MtCO2e of cost-effective emissions reductions in 2030, representing 29.4% of the foams baseline, \\nbased on the assumptions presented in this analysis. No reductions are available in 2010 as a result of the \\nassumption that options did not start to penetrate the market until 2011. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-61 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n-$30 \\n-$20 \\n-$10 \\n$0 \\n$10 \\n$20 \\n$30 \\n$40 \\n$50 \\n$60 \\n0 \\n5 \\n10 \\n15 \\n20 \\n25 \\n30 \\n35 \\n$/tCO2 e \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n40 \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM FOAMS MANUFACTURING \\nFigure 4-2: \\nGlobal Abatement Potential in Foams Manufacturing: 2010, 2020, and 2030 \\nIV.4.2 \\nEmissions from Foams  \\nAlthough there are two main types of foams\\u2014open cell and closed cell\\u2014HFCs are primarily used in \\nclosed-cell foam applications for their physical and performance properties.1 HFC blowing agents are \\nemitted during product/equipment manufacture, use, disposal, and even following disposal (e.g., in \\nlandfills) if the foam substance is not specially treated.

Certain cost assumptions, \\nsuch as capital costs, are adjusted for other regions.2 Otherwise, it is assumed that the costs and \\nreductions achieved in the modeled facilities could be scaled and would be representative of the costs \\nand reductions in other regions. \\nIV.4.2.1  \\nActivity Data, Important Sectoral or Regional Trends and Related \\nAssumptions \\nFoam consumption for the United States is estimated using the U.S. Environmental Protection \\nAgency\\u2019s (USEPA\\u2019s) Vintaging Model. This consumption and associated emissions are assumed to scale \\nwith country gross domestic product (GDP), with several regional adjustments made to account for \\ndifferences in HFC foam consumption based on data provided in FTOC (2010). Specifically, in the \\nEuropean Union, HFC consumption for XPS boardstock and commercial refrigeration is assumed to be \\nlower than in the United States, because of a faster transition to low-GWP alternatives, while no HFC \\nconsumption is assumed in the PU appliance subsector (because the transition away from HFCs is \\nalready complete). Similarly, in developing countries, no HFC consumption is assumed in PU appliance, \\ncommercial refrigeration, XPS boardstock, PU spray, and PU continuous and discontinuous foams, \\nbecause these subsectors are transitioning directly from ODS to non-HFC low-GWP alternatives. \\nAdditionally, a reduced proportion of HFC consumption in PU one-component foam is assumed in \\ndeveloping countries relative to the U.S. subsector (with consumption assumed only for HFC-134a, not \\nHFC-152a). \\nIV.4.2.2  \\nEmission Estimates and Related Assumptions \\nGlobal HFC emissions from foams were estimated at 22 MtCO2e in 2010, projected to grow to 52 \\nMtCO2e by 2020 and 92 MtCO2e by 2030. Growth in emissions is driven by GDP. Globally, HFC emissions \\nfrom foam production and use have been growing because of the phaseout of ODS under the Montreal \\nProtocol. Because of the costs associated with HFC-based foams, many countries have transitioned/are \\ntransitioning from ODS to hydrocarbons or other non-HFC alternatives. Because of developing countries\\u2019 \\nminimal use of HFCs, the growth in global emissions for the past decade has been driven by emissions \\nfrom developed countries.

Approximately 50% of hydrocarbons used in appliances are based on cyclopentane and \\nisopentane, due to their low operating costs and good foam properties (UNEP, 2010; TEAP, 2012). \\nCyclopentane has also been blended with isobutene to improve flow-ability and compressive strength, or \\nwith methylal, to improve performance (UNEP, 2010).

Using HCs instead of HFC-245fa in PU appliance \\nfoam eliminates HFC emissions at all stages of the product life cycle (i.e., at manufacturing, during \\nappliance use, and at appliance disposal). \\nThis option applies to HFC-245fa in newly manufactured PU appliance foam. This option is not \\napplied in the European Union or in developing countries, because no HFC consumption is assumed in \\nthis application in the baseline. One-time costs are estimated at approximately $4.8 million per facility for \\nsafety modifications, installation/retrofit of high-pressure foam dispensers, installation of systems storage \\ntanks, pumps, and premixing stations, as well as training, trials, testing, and certification (TEAP, 2012; \\nUNEP, 2011a). Incremental annual costs associated with replacement formulations are estimated at \\napproximately $1.6 million (UNEP, 2011a). These annual costs are more than offset by annual savings of \\nnearly $4.4 million associated with lower blowing agent costs. \\nIV.4.3.2 \\nHCs in Commercial Refrigeration \\nThis option replaces HFC-245fa used in commercial refrigeration foam with HCs, namely \\ncyclopentane and cyclopentane/isopentane blends.

Use of \\ncyclopentane and cyclo/iso blends in commercial refrigeration has a particularly good balance between \\nfoam properties and density. Such HC blends are associated with low operating costs and are well-\\nproven (UNEP, 2010; TEAP, 2012).

This \\noption is not applied in developing countries, because no HFC consumption is assumed in this \\napplication in the baseline. One-time costs are estimated at about $1.26 million per facility associated with \\nsafety modifications, installation/retrofit of high-pressure foam dispensers, installation of hydrocarbon \\nstorage systems, pumps, and premixing stations, as well as, safety audits, trials, and training (TEAP, \\n2012; UNEP, 2011b).

HCs are inexpensive and have near-zero direct GWPs. However, it should \\nbe noted that technical issues exist with using hydrocarbons, including flammability, which may render \\nthis alternative unsafe in some spray applications (TEAP, 2012). Using HCs instead of HFC-245fa/CO2 in \\nPU spray foam would eliminate HFC emissions during application (first year) and over the product \\nlifetime (USEPA, 2009). \\nThis option applies to all HFC-245fa/CO2 in newly manufactured PU spray foam. This option is not \\napplied in developing countries, because no HFC consumption is assumed in this application in the \\nbaseline. One-time costs are estimated at $15,700 per contractor for new formulations and equipment \\n(e.g., spray nozzles), while annual operating costs are estimated at $45,200 for fire retardant, worker \\nsafety training, and cost increases from blowing agent density change. These annual costs are offset by \\nannual savings of $50,400 associated with lower blowing agent costs. \\nIV.4.3.4 \\nCO2 in Polyurethane Spray Foams \\nThis option replaces HFC-245fa/CO2 blends used in PU spray foam with CO2 (water). In the process \\nof using CO2 (water) in foams, first isocyanate and the polyol or polyamine react to form a polymer, \\nwhich forms a solid. Water is introduced and a chemical reaction between the water and polymeric \\nisocyanate produces CO2, which is used as a blowing agent. Using CO2 (water) instead of HFC-245fa in \\nPU spray foams eliminates HFC emissions during the production and application stages and over the \\nproduct lifetime (USEPA, 2009). CO2 is considered to have moderate foam properties (due to its high \\nthermal conductivity and high density), and requires greater thickness that leads to a cost penalty \\ncompared to other options (TEAP, 2012). The use of CO2 in this application is most predominant in Japan, \\nwith reported use also in North America and Spain (UNEP, 2010). \\nThis option applies to all HFC-245fa/CO2 in newly manufactured PU spray foam. This option is not \\napplied in developing countries, because no HFC consumption is assumed in this application in the \\nbaseline. One-time costs are estimated at $4,600 per contractor (for new formulations and minimal \\nequipment modifications), while annual operating costs are estimated at $60,700 (for fire retardant and \\nthe cost increase from blowing agent density change). These annual costs are partly offset by annual \\nsavings of $10,700 associated with lower agent costs. \\nIV.4.3.5 \\nLCD/Alcohol in XPS Boardstock \\nThis option replaces the HFC-134a and CO2-based blends used in extruded polystyrene (XPS) \\nboardstock foam with liquid CO2 (LCD)/alcohol. LCD is blended with other foam components under \\npressure prior to the initiation of the chemical reaction. When decompressed, the CO2 expands, resulting \\nin froth foam that further expands with the additional release of CO2 from the water/isocyanate resin \\nreaction that forms the PU foam matrix. Difficulties encountered in using LCD include the limited \\nsolubility of the chemical mixture, controlled decompression, and distribution of the unavoidable froth \\n(USEPA, 2009). Foams blown with CO2 may suffer from lower thermal performance, lower dimensional \\nstability, and higher density versus fluorocarbon-blown foams (USEPA, 2009). To overcome these \\nlimitations, CO2 can be blended with HCs or HFCs (Williams et al., 1999; Honeywell, 2000; Alliance, \\n2001). \\nThis option applies to all HFC-134a/CO2 blends in newly manufactured XPS boardstock foam. This \\noption is not applied in developing countries, because no HFC consumption is assumed in this \\napplication in the baseline. This analysis assesses the costs for the foam producer to replace an HFC\\u00ad\\n134a/CO2-based blend with LCD/alcohol in one of 10 production lines.

Technical issues exist with \\nusing HCs, such as flammability and lower insulation performance, but these can be overcome through \\nproper safety controls and engineering design (USEPA, 2009). A significant advantage of hydrocarbons is \\nthat they can be easily blended to impact a range of properties, such as thermal performance, cell gas \\npressure, and foam density, as well as cost (TEAP, 2012). Use of butane and propane in one component \\nfoams is well proven and is associated with low operating costs (TEAP, 2012). Using HCs instead of HFC\\u00ad\\n134a in PU one-component foams eliminates HFC emissions during manufacturing and over an assumed \\nproduct lifetime of 1 year (USEPA, 2009). \\nThis option applies to all HFC-134a in newly manufactured PU one-component foam in both \\ndeveloped and developing countries. One-time costs are estimated at $399,0003 per facility (for capital \\ncosts and safety equipment), while annual operating costs are estimated at $342,000 (for fire retardant and \\nworker safety training). These annual costs are offset by annual savings of $859,000 associated with lower \\nagent costs. \\nIV.4.3.7 \\nHFC-152a to HCs in PU One-Component Foam \\nSimilar to the option above, this option replaces HFC-152a used in PU one-component foam with \\nHCs, specifically a 50/50 blend of propane and butane. \\nThis option applies to all HFC-152a in newly manufactured PU one-component foam.

This option involves \\nmanual labor to disassemble appliances and remove the foam in large pieces; the recovered foam is then \\nsealed in plastic bags to prevent further off-gassing of the blowing agent and subsequently sent for \\nincineration in a waste-to-energy plant. This practice is currently being used in the United States and \\nCanada, where voluntary programs and/or demand-side management programs are in place to \\nencourage the safe disposal of inefficient appliances (CARB, 2011). \\nThis abatement option applies to existing domestic refrigerators reaching disposal. This option is not \\napplied in the European Union or in developing countries, because no baseline HFC consumption is \\nassumed in PU appliances (further, recovery of foam at appliance equipment EOL is assumed in the EU \\nbaseline). One-time costs are estimated at $1 million per facility (for automated saws), while net annual \\noperating costs are estimated at $4,865,000 per facility for labor and handling costs (CARB, 2011). \\nIV.4.3.10 \\nFully Automated Blowing Agent Recovery from Appliances at EOL \\nSimilar to the previous option, this option involves the recovery of foam at the end of the appliance\\u2019s \\nlife, but instead using fully automated appliance dismantling machines that separate all components, \\nincluding the foam-blowing agent. The blowing agent is then reconcentrated and sent to a destruction \\nfacility approved to destroy ODS, while the remaining foam fluff is typically sent to a landfill. Fully \\nautomated appliance recycling technologies can handle an estimated annual throughput of 150,000 to \\n250,000 units (CARB, 2011). \\nThis abatement option applies to existing domestic refrigerators reaching disposal. This option is not \\napplied in the European Union or in developing countries, because no baseline HFC consumption is \\nassumed in this application. One-time costs are estimated at $5,000,000 per facility (for the fully \\nautomated unit), while net annual operating costs are estimated at $6,130,000 per facility for labor, \\nhandling, and electricity costs (CARB, 2011). \\nIV.4.3.11 \\nSolstice Liquid Blowing Agent in PU Foams \\nSolstice Liquid Blowing Agent5 produced by Honeywell (also referred to as Solstice LBA, Solstice \\n1233zd(E), or Trans-1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-ene) is under development/in early commercialization \\n4 Foam recovery from disposed appliances is already mandatory in a number of countries, including Japan and the \\nEuropean Union. \\n5 Other unsaturated HFCs and HCFCs with low GWPs are being developed by DuPont and Arkema, among others, \\nfor use in PU and other foam applications, which are likely to be commercialized in the coming years.

Recently, Whirlpool \\nannounced that by 2014, Solstice LBA will be used in all of the company\\u2019s refrigerators produced in the \\nUnited States (Whirlpool, 2012). Solstice LBA has a GWP of 4.7 to 7 (USEPA, 2012b). The foam blowing \\nagent is also considered to be nonflammable (Honeywell, 2012a), which could limit capital costs to \\nconvert from an HFC to this product. Solstice LBA exhibits relatively high performance and is considered \\na drop-in alternative to HFCs, with no additional capital costs (TEAP, 2012). Any significant cost is \\nexpected to be the result of the incremental cost of the blowing agent, which is expected to range from \\n$11/kg to $17/kg (TEAP, 2012; Williams, 2013), but which may be lower, especially once production \\nvolume increases. Recent evaluations showed up to a 4% improvement in energy efficiency compared to \\nHFC-245fa in domestic refrigerators (TEAP, 2012; Honeywell, 2012a), and a 5% to 10% energy \\nperformance improvement compared to HFC-245fa in spray and panel foams (Honeywell, 2012a), \\nmaking it an attractive and likely option for markets where thermal insulation properties of the foam are \\nimportant, such as in domestic refrigerators. With its low GWP, Solstice 1233zd(E) could be used in lieu \\nof HC abatement options analyzed above for PU foams applications and achieve similar emission \\nreductions, but at different costs. Because it is nonflammable and of similar properties as the HFCs it \\nwould replace, it would avoid some of the barriers due to pressure and flammability that exist with the \\nother options, such as in PU spray foam, and hence may penetrate those markets further or faster than the \\noptions currently analyzed. This option is not quantitatively assessed in this analysis but may be added \\nas a future update. \\nIV.4.3.12 \\nSolstice Gas Blowing Agent in XPS Foam and One-Component Foam \\nSolstice Gas Blowing Agent6 (also referred to as Solstice GBA, Solstice 1234ze(E), and HFO-1234ze) \\ncan replace HFC-134a used in PU one-component foam and is under development/in early \\ncommercialization to replace HFC-134a in XPS foam beginning in 2013. The blowing agent has been \\ncommercial since 2008, with initial sales starting in the EU and Japan; approval for sales in the United \\nStates was awarded in 2011 (Honeywell, 2012a). The GWP of Solstice GBA is <6 and it is considered to be \\nnonflammable up to temperatures of 28\\u00b0C (82.4\\u00b0F) (TEAP, 2012). In XPS foam, Solstice GBA has shown \\ngood insulation performance (i.e., energy efficiency) and compressive strength and dimensional stability \\nsimilar to HFC-134a, and allows extrusion of thick foam (Honeywell, 2012a), making it an attractive and \\nlikely option for markets where such properties of the foam are important, such as in XPS foam. Solstice \\nGBA can be used as a near drop-in replacement for HFC-134a, and can be handled, transported, and \\nstored in the same manner (Honeywell, 2012b). Transition to Solstice GBA is anticipated to require \\nnegligible capital costs (TEAP, 2012; Williams, 2013). Any significant cost is expected to be the result of \\nthe incremental cost associated with the blowing agent, which is estimated to range from $11/kg to $17/kg \\n(TEAP, 2012; Williams, 2013) but which may be lower, especially once production volume increases. With \\nits low GWP, HFO-1234ze(E) could be used in lieu of LCD/alcohol in XPS foam and hydrocarbons in one\\u00ad\\n6 Other unsaturated HFCs and HCFCs with low GWPs are being developed by DuPont and Arkema, among others, \\nin XPS, one-component, and other foam, which are likely to be commercialized in the coming years. These \\ncompounds may be expected to have similar GWPs and applications as the Solstice compounds described here. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-70 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM FOAMS MANUFACTURING \\ncomponent foam and achieve similar emission reductions, but at different costs. Because it is \\nnonflammable and of similar properties as the HFCs it would replace, it would avoid some of the barriers \\ndue to controlling decompression and flammability that exist with the other options, and hence may \\npenetrate those markets further or faster than the options currently analyzed. This option is not \\nquantitatively assessed in this analysis but may be added as a future update. \\nIV.4.3.13 \\nMethyl Formate in PU and XPS Foams \\nMethyl formate may replace HFCs in commercial refrigeration, continuous and discontinuous panels, \\nspray foam, transport refrigeration foam, and XPS foam. It is currently used in PU spray foams \\ninternationally, including Africa, Asia, Americas, Australia, China, and Europe (Ecomate, 2012). Methyl \\nformate was approved as a \\u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\\u201d substance by the U.S. Food and Drug \\nAdministration (Ecomate, 2012) and has a negligible GWP (TEAP, 2012). It may be blended with polyols \\nto produce non-flammable blends that reduce conversion costs (TEAP, 2012). In commercial refrigeration \\nand panel foam, corrosion protection is recommended and may require moderate incremental capital \\ncosts (TEAP, 2012). This option is reportedly associated with a 10% increase in operating costs due to the \\nneed for higher densities to address foam instability (UNEP, 2010). Generally, use of this alternative does \\nnot require large capital changes to facilities (Ecomate, 2012). One producer of rigid foams for refrigerated \\ntransport applications in Brazil completed conversion to methyl formate within 3 years and has since \\nreported an increase in the productivity of the lines and reduced operational costs compared to HFC-134a \\n(Crestani, 2012). Relative to hydrocarbon systems, methyl formate is safer to handle, and has lower \\nshipping, handling, and storage costs (Ecomate, 2012). The GWP of methyl formate is similar to that of \\nthe options examined in this report; hence, emission reductions would be similar. Due to a lack of readily \\navailable cost information on this alternative, this option is not quantitatively assessed in this analysis. \\nIV.4.4 \\nEngineering Cost Data Summary \\nTable 4-3 presents the engineering cost data for each mitigation option outlined above, including all \\ncost parameters necessary to calculate the break-even price. \\nTable 4-3: \\nEngineering Cost Data on a Facility Basis \\nProject \\nAnnual \\nAnnual O&M \\nAbatement \\nLifetime \\nCapital Cost \\nRevenue \\nCosts \\nAmount \\nAbatement Option \\nFacility Type \\n(Years) \\n(2010 USD) \\n(2010 USD) \\n(2010 USD) \\n(tCO2e) \\nAppliance: HFCs to \\nHCs \\nPU appliance foam \\nmanufacturing facility \\n25 \\n$4,831,000 \\n$4,375,000 \\n$1,610,000 \\n509,951 \\nCommercial \\nrefrigeration: HFCs to \\nHCs \\nPU commercial refrigeration \\nfoam manufacturing facility \\n15 \\n$1,260,000 \\n$602,000 \\n$105,000 \\n66,500 \\nSpray: HFC245fa/CO2 \\nto HC \\nPU spray foam contractor \\n25 \\n$15,700 \\n$50,400 \\n$45,200 \\n54,654 \\nSpray: HFC245fa/CO2 \\nto CO2 \\nPU spray foam contractor \\n25 \\n$4,600 \\n$10,700 \\n$60,700 \\n54,654 \\nXPS: HFC134a/CO2 to \\nLCD/alcohol \\nXPS boardstock production \\nfacility \\n25 \\n$5,856,000 \\n$4,770,000 \\n$915,000 \\n9,168 \\nOne-component: \\nHFC-134a to HCs \\u2014 \\nDeveloped \\nOne-component foam \\nmanufacturing facility \\n25 \\n$399,000 \\n$859,000 \\n$342,000 \\n169,603 \\n(continued) \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-71 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM FOAMS MANUFACTURING \\nTable 4-3: \\nEngineering Cost Data on a Facility Basis (continued) \\nProject \\nAnnual \\nAnnual O&M \\nAbatement \\nLifetime \\nCapital Cost \\nRevenue \\nCosts \\nAmount \\nAbatement Option \\nFacility Type \\n(Years) \\n(2010 USD) \\n(2010 USD) \\n(2010 USD) \\n(tCO2e) \\nOne-component: \\nHFC-134a to HCs\\u2014 \\nDeveloping \\nOne-component foam \\nmanufacturing facility \\n25 \\n$438,900 \\n$859,000 \\n$342,000 \\n169,603 \\nOne-component: \\nHFC-152a to HCs \\nOne-component foam \\nmanufacturing facility \\n25 \\n$399,000 \\n$409,000 \\n$342,000 \\n18,265 \\nContinuous and \\nPU continuous and \\ndiscontinuous: \\ndiscontinuous foams \\n25 \\n$319,000 \\n$2,937,000 \\n$2,490,000 \\n588,900 \\nHFC134a to HCs \\nmanufacturing facility \\nAppliance EOL: \\nManual process \\nAppliance demanufacturing \\nfacility using manual \\nblowing agent recovery \\n25 \\n$1,000,000 \\n\\u2014 \\n$4,865,000 \\n99,380 \\nAppliance EOL: Fully \\nautomated process \\nAppliance demanufacturing \\nfacility using fully automated \\nblowing agent recovery \\n25 \\n$5,000,000 \\n\\u2014 \\n$6,130,000 \\n177,716 \\nIV.4.5 \\nMarginal Abatement Cost Analysis  \\nIV.4.5.1 \\nMethodological Approach \\nThe analysis is based on the above representative project costs for model facilities. We applied the \\ncosts to calculate the break-even prices for each appropriate option and facility or operation. The model \\nestimates the mitigation potential based on the percentage of the total ODS substitutes\\u2019 baseline (that is, \\nthe HFC emissions from sectors that historically used ODSs) attributable to each representative \\nfacility/operation and the technical effectiveness for each technology in each facility. \\nIV.4.5.2 \\nAssessment of Technical Effectiveness \\nThe analysis also developed a technical effectiveness parameter, defined as the percentage reductions \\nachievable by each technology/facility type combination. Estimating this parameter requires making a \\nnumber of assumptions regarding the distribution of emissions by facility in addition to process-specific \\nestimates of technical applicability and market penetration. Market penetration is a modeled value that \\ntakes into account the market\\u2019s willingness to adopt the option, the rate of uptake of the alternative into \\nnew foams, and the lifetime of the existing foam base. Because foam lifetimes can be decades, replacing \\nthe stock of foams with non-HFC blowing agents will take many years. The market penetration rate is \\nmodeled to capture such time lapses. Technical effectiveness figures do not account for indirect \\ngreenhouse gas impacts associated with changes in electricity consumption (e.g., for foam blowing \\nprocesses or for end-of-life appliance processing), which are accounted for in the cost analysis.7 Table 4-4 \\nsummarizes these assumptions and presents technical effectiveness parameters used in the MAC model. \\n7 Indirect greenhouse gas emissions are not accounted for in the technical effectiveness calculations so that the \\nanalysis can show purely ODS substitute (i.e., HFC) emission reductions achievable. It is recognized that indirect \\nGHG emissions can be significant, and such differences, to the extent data is available on such, are accounted for in \\nthe cost analyses. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-72 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM FOAMS MANUFACTURING \\nTable 4-4: \\nTechnical Effectiveness Summary \\nFacility/Abatement Option  \\nTechnical Applicability  \\nMarket  \\nPenetration  \\nRate (2030)a  \\nReduction \\nEfficiency  \\nTechnical \\nEffectiveness \\n(2030)b  \\nAppliance: HFCs to HCs\\u2014U.S./Other \\ndeveloped  \\nNew PU appliances  \\n100% \\n100% \\n37% \\nCommercial  refrigeration: HFCs to  \\nHCs\\u2014Developed  \\nNew PU commercial \\nrefrigeration units   \\n100% \\n100%  \\n39%  \\nSpray:  HFC245fa/CO2 to HC\\u2014Developed  \\nNew spray foam applications   \\n30%  \\n100%  \\n9%  \\nSpray: HFC245fa/CO2 to CO2\\u2014Developed  New spray foam applications   \\n70%  \\n100%  \\n22%  \\nXPS: HFC134a/CO2 to LCD/Alcohol\\u2014 \\nU.S./Other developed  \\nNew XPS boardstock foam  \\napplications   \\n75%  \\n100% \\n66% \\nXPS: HFC134a/CO2 to LCD/Alcohol\\u2014EU  \\nNew XPS boardstock foam  \\napplications   \\n75%  \\n100%  \\n55%  \\nOne-component: HFC-134a to HCs\\u2014 \\nDeveloped & developing \\nNew PU one-component foam \\napplications   \\n100% \\n100% \\n94% \\nOne-component: HFC-152a to HCs\\u2014 \\nDeveloped  \\nNew PU one-component foam  \\napplications   \\n100% \\n100%  \\n6% \\nContinuous and Discontinuous: HFC134a  \\nto HCs\\u2014Developed  \\nNew PU continuous and \\ndiscontinuous foam applications   \\n100% \\n100% \\n49% \\nAppliance EOL:  Manual  process\\u2014 \\nU.S./Other developed   \\nDomestic refrigerators  reaching \\nend of life   \\n50%  \\n85%  \\n29%  \\nAppliance EOL:  Fully  automated  \\nprocess\\u2014U.S./Other developed  \\nDomestic refrigerators reaching \\nend of life \\n20% \\n95% \\n12% \\na Market penetration assumptions for this analysis vary over time, and the technical effectiveness values are based on the cumulative market \\npenetration rates assumed until that point.

HFC Emissions  from  Aerosol Product Use  \\nIV.5.1 \\nSector Summary  \\nA\\nerosol propellant formulations containing HFCs are used in a variety of consumer products, \\nsuch as spray deodorants and hair sprays, and specialty aerosol uses, such as freeze spray \\nand dust removal products. Additionally, aerosol propellants containing HFCs are used in \\npharmaceutical products, primarily metered dose inhalers (MDIs). \\nGlobal HFC emissions from the aerosols sector were estimated at roughly 45 million metric tons of \\ncarbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2010 and are expected to climb to 146 MtCO2e by 2030 as shown \\nin Figure 5-1. A majority of the growth is attributed to an increase in the consumption of HFCs for aerosol \\napplications in developing countries. \\nFigure  5-1:  \\nHFC Emissions from Aerosol Product Use: 2000\\u20132030 (MtCO2e)  \\nSource: USEPA, 2012. \\nA variety of abatement measures are available to reduce emissions. For consumer aerosol products, \\nthe options include transitioning to replacement propellants with very low global warming potentials \\n(GWPs) and converting to a not-in-kind (NIK) alternative, such as a stick, roller, or finger/trigger pumps. \\nDry powder inhaler (DPI) technology is considered in this analysis as a replacement measure for MDIs. \\nThe global abatement potential from aerosols is equal to approximately 66% of total annual emissions \\nfrom the aerosols sector and 5% of total annual emissions from all sectors that use ODS substitutes. \\nPotentially, nearly 100% abatement is possible for consumer aerosol products; whereas abatement is more \\nlimited for MDIs due to medical reasons (e.g., DPIs are not suitable for cases of severe asthma or for \\nyoung children). Marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve results are presented in Figure 5-2. Maximum \\nabatement potential in the aerosols sector is 97 MtCO2e in 2030. There are 70 MtCO2e of emissions \\nreductions that are cost-effective at currently projected energy prices for 2030. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-79 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n-$30 \\n-$20 \\n-$10 \\n$0 \\n$10 \\n$20 \\n$30 \\n$40 \\n$50 \\n$60 \\n0 \\n10 \\n20 \\n30 \\n40 \\n50 \\n60 \\n70 \\n80 \\n90 \\n$/tCO2e \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM AEROSOL PRODUCT USE \\nFigure 5-2: \\nGlobal Abatement Potential in Aerosol Product Use: 2010, 2020, and 2030 \\nIV.5.2 \\nEmissions from Aerosol Product Use  \\nAerosol propellants are completely emitted during product use. This analysis estimates emissions \\nfrom consumer aerosol products, such as spray deodorants and hair sprays, and specialty aerosol uses, \\nsuch as freeze spray and dust removal products, and, separately, emissions from MDIs. HFC-134a has \\nbeen introduced as an alternative propellant to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in both MDIs and consumer \\naerosol products; in addition, HFC-227ea is used in MDIs and HFC-152a is used in consumer aerosol \\napplications. This analysis characterizes these three categories, for the purposes of evaluating the cost of \\nreducing HFC emissions, as follows: \\n\\u2022  \\na facility that produces 10 million consumer aerosol cans per year, with each can containing an \\nHFC-134a aerosol propellant charge of two ounces; \\n\\u2022  \\na facility that produces 10 million consumer aerosol cans per year, with each can containing an \\nHFC-152a aerosol propellant charge of two ounces; and \\n\\u2022  \\na single 200-dose MDI aerosol unit with a charge size of 15 grams that uses HFC-134a propellant. \\nThe relative shares of these applications are displayed in Figure  5-3.  \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-80 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC-134a \\nNon-MDI \\nAerosols, \\n34% \\nHFC-152a \\nNon-MDI \\nAerosols, \\n24% \\nMDI \\nAerosols, \\n42% \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM AEROSOL PRODUCT USE \\nFigure 5-3: \\nGlobal HFC Emissions in 2020 by Facility Type (% of GWP-Weighted Emissions) \\nIV.5.2.1 \\nActivity Data or Important Sectoral or Regional Trends \\nHFC emissions from the aerosols sector represented 10% of total ODS substitute emissions in 2010. \\nEmissions were estimated based on estimated market size and charge size of aerosol products in the \\nUnited States, which was then proxied to other regions based on each country\\u2019s gross domestic product. \\nGrowth in aerosol products correlates with economic growth, and because of the global, commoditized \\nnature of this sector, there are no significant regional differences in the aerosol products themselves. \\nAerosols are fully emissive, and the HFCs contained within the aerosol are assumed to be emitted within \\na year of consumption. Many non-MDI aerosols already use alternative propellants, either hydrocarbons \\n(HCs) or manual pump mechanisms; thus, the baseline adoption of the reduction technologies is quite \\nhigh in the market. \\nIV.5.2.2 \\nEmission Estimates and Related Assumptions \\nGlobal emissions of HFCs from the aerosols sector were estimated to be 45 MtCO2e in 2010, growing \\nto 146 MtCO2e in 2030, as shown in Table 5-1. The majority of emissions are HFC-134a, with lesser \\namounts of HFC-152a and HFC-227ea. Emissions are projected to grow significantly as developing \\ncountries\\u2019 economies grow and demand for consumer aerosols grows. Emissions were estimated using \\nUSEPA\\u2019s Vintaging Model and assumptions about initial market size of the sector, the specific transitions \\naway from CFCs in terms of timing and alternative propellant used, charge sizes, and leak rates. \\nIV.5.3 \\nAbatement Measures and Engineering Cost Analysis \\nA total of five abatement options were identified for the aerosols sector. For consumer aerosol \\nproducts, the options are transitioning to a replacement propellant\\u2014including HCs, HFO-1234ze, and \\nHFC-152a (for those products containing HFC-134a)\\u2014and converting to a NIK alternative, such as a stick, \\nroller, or finger/trigger pump. Costs are analyzed by looking at a model facility that uses HFC to fill 10 \\nmillion aerosol cans a year. For MDIs, the abatement measure examined by this analysis is further use of \\ndry powder inhaler technology where suitable for the patient.

HC \\naerosol propellants are usually mixtures of propane, butane, and isobutane.1 Their primary advantage \\nlies in their affordability; the price of HC propellants which range from one-third to one-half that of \\nHFCs. The main disadvantages of HC aerosol propellants are flammability concerns and, because they \\nare volatile organic compounds (VOCs), their contribution to ground-level ozone and smog. Despite \\nthese concerns, HC aerosol propellants already hold a sizable share of the market and may be acceptable \\nfor additional applications. \\n1 For calculation purposes, a GWP of 3.48 is used based on an average of the GWP of propane (GWP=3.3) and \\nisobutane (GWP=3.65). \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-82 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM AEROSOL PRODUCT USE \\nTable 5-2: \\nAerosol Product Use Abatement Options \\nAbatement Option  \\nReduction Efficiency  \\nApplicability  \\nConsumer  \\nAerosol  \\nFacility/  \\nHFC -134a  \\nConsumer  \\nAerosol  \\nFacility/ \\nHFC -152a  \\nConsumer Aerosol Products  \\nHydrocarbon \\n99.7% \\n97.5% \\nNA \\nConsumer aerosol facility/HFC-134a/HFC-152a \\nNot-in-kind  \\n100% \\n100% \\nNA \\nConsumer aerosol facility/HFC-134a/HFC-152a  \\nHFO-1234ze  \\n99.5% \\n95.7% \\nNA \\nConsumer aerosol facility/HFC-134a/HFC-152a  \\nHFC-134a to HFC-152a  \\n89.2% \\nConsumer aerosol  facility/HFC-134a  \\nPharmaceutical Aerosol Products (MDIs) \\nDry powder inhalers  \\nNA \\nNA \\n100% \\nMetered dose inhaler \\nMetered  \\nDose \\nInhaler  \\nCosts of converting filling facilities to accept HC propellants can range from $10,000 to potentially as \\nhigh as $1.2 million; the one-time cost varies based on the need for investments in new equipment and \\nthe need to relocate to regions where the use of HCs is considered safe (Nardini, 2002). To accommodate \\nany flammable propellant, a company is required to build a storage tank to house the product. This tank \\nwill need to be connected to the main facility through a plumbing system (Techspray, 2008; MicroCare, \\n2008). According to discussions with industry, the majority of companies would already have fire \\ninsurance and other fire safety precautions intact; therefore, no significant additional costs would be \\nassociated with housing a flammable chemical, and the increase in annual costs would be zero \\n(Techspray, 2008; MicroCare, 2008). Given that HCs (estimated at $1/lb) are lower cost than HFC-134a or \\nHFC-152a (estimated at $3/lb and $2/lb, respectively), the adoption of this abatement measure is expected \\nto result in an annual savings associated with gas purchases, ranging from $1 million to nearly $3 million. \\nIV.5.3.2 \\nNot-in-Kind \\nNIK aerosol devices include finger/trigger pumps, powder formulations, sticks, rollers, brushes, \\nnebulizers, and bag-in-can/piston-can systems. These systems often prove to be a better and more cost-\\neffective option than HFC-propelled aerosols, particularly in areas where a unique HFC property is not \\nspecifically needed. Because all of the HFC (either HFC-134a or HFC-152a) contained in the aerosol can is \\nreplaced with a device that does not use any GHGs, the reduction efficiency of this option is 100%. \\nSignificant variability exists in financial components of projects targeting NIK replacements for HFC-\\ncontaining aerosol products. This variability is attributable to the wide range of potential aerosol and NIK \\nproduct types. A one-time cost to make the conversion is estimated at $250,000; additionally, annual costs \\nof $500,000 are estimated to address higher material costs of the particular sticks, rollers, and pumps \\nbeing used (UNEP, 1999). An annual savings is expected, ranging from $2.3 million to $4.1 million, as a \\nresult of eliminating the need for a HFC propellant. \\nIV.5.3.3 \\nHFO-1234ze \\nHFO-1234ze has potential application both as a propellant and also as the active ingredient in aerosol \\ndusters. HFO-1234ze is nonflammable (at room temperature) and has physical properties that are very \\nsimilar to both the HFC-134a and HFC-152a. Hence, it may be used as a \\u2018drop-in\\u2019 replacement for HFC \\npropellants (MicroCare, 2011). The manufacturer of this chemical indicates that Europe and Japan have \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-83 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC EMISSIONS FROM AEROSOL PRODUCT USE \\nalready begun to adopt HFO-1234ze, while interest is also rising in the United States because of \\nawareness of environmental sustainability (Honeywell, 2011a). A number of dusters using HFO-1234ze \\nare available today (Amazon, 2013; ITW Chemtronics, 2013; Miller Stephenson, 2013; Stanley Supply and \\nServices, 2013). A large scale production facility is being built in the United States with an expected \\nproduction of HFO-1234ze in late 2013 (Honeywell, 2011b). In the absence of regulations, adoption in \\nEurope and Japan is expected to grow continuously at a moderate rate (reaching a maximum of 15% to \\n20% of today\\u2019s HFC volume); therefore, this option is expected to penetrate up to 15% of the non-MDI \\nHFC-134a market and up to 20% of the non-MDI HFC-152a market. In the United States, adoption of \\nHFO-1234ze is expected to follow a similar path, but with a later start. In developing countries, no \\ninterest in HFO-1234ze is expected in the foreseeable future because of inexpensive options that are the \\npreferred solutions today. \\nFor this analysis, a one-time cost of roughly $500,000 is assumed because of the need for bulk storage. \\nAccording to MicroCare (2011), although it is possible to use one ton cylinders and avoid the costs of \\nadding bulk storage, using ton cylinders is inefficient and adds to the unit cost of the HFO material. \\nTherefore, any facility using this material would almost certainly need to use bulk storage. This is likely a \\nconservative (high) one-time cost estimate, considering it is about the same capital cost considered in the \\nnext section for a flammable propellant, whereas HFO-1234ze(E) is not flammable at room temperatures. \\nBecause HFO-1234ze has a higher cost than the other HFCs (i.e., HFC-134a and HFC-152a), a facility \\nmaking the transition would incur a higher annual cost when adopting this propellant. \\nIV.5.3.4 \\nHFC-134a to HFC-152a \\nThis abatement measure examines replacing HFC-134a (with a GWP of 1,300) with HFC-152a (with a \\nGWP of 140). HFC-134a is assumed to represent 58% of non-MDI aerosols; therefore, this abatement \\noption is only applicable to 58% of the non-MDI aerosol model facilities. HFC-134a is the primary \\nnonflammable propellant in certain industrial products. HFC-152a possesses only moderate flammability \\nhazards and might, therefore, be acceptable for some applications that use HFC-134a, but it may present \\nproblems for other applications. \\nCosts of converting filling facilities to accept HFC-152a may range from $500,000 to $600,000, \\n(Techspray, 2008; MicroCare, 2008). To accommodate HFC-152a (or any flammable propellant), a \\ncompany is required to build a storage tank to house the product. This tank will need to be connected to \\nthe main facility through a plumbing system (Techspray, 2008). Aside from the costs associated with \\nbuilding a storage house, no other significant expenses would be incurred. According to discussions with \\nindustry, the majority of companies would already have fire insurance and other fire safety precautions \\nintact; therefore, no significant additional costs would be associated with housing a flammable chemical, \\nand the increase in annual costs would be zero (Techspray, 2008; MicroCare, 2008). The lower cost of \\nHFC-152a (compared with HFC-134a) results in an annual savings associated with gas purchases, \\nestimated at $1.8 million for a typical aerosol filling facility. \\nIV.5.3.5 \\nDry Powder Inhalers \\nDry powder inhalers (DPIs) are a viable abatement measure for most anti-asthma drugs, although \\nthey are not successful with all patients or all drugs. Micronised dry powder, that contains the drug \\nagent, is contained in the DPI, a non-pressurized delivery system, and is inhaled and deposited in the \\nlungs. They are suitable only in patients who are able to inhale robustly enough to transport the powder \\nto the lungs. DPIs are not suitable for persons with severe asthma or for young children. Unlike MDIs, \\npowdered drug particles contained in DPIs tend to aggregate and may cause problems in areas with hot \\nand humid climates.

Ultimately, these and other critical \\npatient care issues must be assessed by the doctor and patient in choosing whether a DPI, MDI or other \\ntype of therapy is most appropriate (Price et al., 2004; UNEP, 2010). Where feasible, DPIs\\u2014which do not \\ncontain GHGs\\u2014could be used in lieu of HFC-containing MDIs; hence, the reduction efficiency of this \\noption is 100%. \\nCosts incurred with using DPIs include the increased cost of DPI treatment, the cost to market the \\nnew treatment, and the cost to retrain patients to use the DPI (Enviros, 2000). The cost of research and \\ndevelopment of new drugs and delivery mechanisms can also be significant; however, as both MDIs and \\nDPIs are available to the market today, and due to a lack of specific cost information, such expenses are \\nnot considered in this analysis. \\nIV.5.3.6 \\nEngineering Cost Data Summary \\nTable 5-3 presents the engineering cost data for each mitigation option outlined above, including all \\ncost parameters necessary to calculate the break-even price.

HFC  and PFC Emissions from Fire Protection  \\nIV.6.1 \\nSector Summary  \\nT\\nhe fire protection sector emits hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) from \\nthe use of total flooding fire protection systems in fire suppression. This sector also includes \\nportable (hand-held) fire extinguishers. Greenhouse gas emissions from the fire protection \\nsector (excluding halons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons) were estimated at roughly 21 million metric tons \\nof carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2010, as shown in Figure 6-1. By 2030, emissions from this \\nsector are expected to reach over 59 MtCO2e. A majority of the growth will result from increased use of \\nHFCs in developing countries. \\nFigure  6-1:  \\nHFC and PFC Emissions from Fire Protection: 2000\\u20132030 (MtCO2e)  \\nSource: USEPA, 2012.  \\nThis analysis reviews options to reduce emissions from the fire protection sector by using \\nextinguishing agents with low global warming potential (GWP) in lieu of HFCs/PFCs in new total \\nflooding equipment, specifically, replacement of the HFC with inert gas, water mist, or the agent \\nFK-5-1-12. \\nThe global abatement potential from the fire protection options reviewed is equal to approximately \\n11% of total annual emissions from the fire protection sector and 0.3% of total annual emissions from all \\nsectors that use ODS substitutes. The options identified to abate emissions in the fire protection sector \\ncompletely replace the fluorinated fire protection agents, however, they are assumed to only be \\nimplemented when new systems are built. Thus, their effectiveness at reducing emissions will increase \\nover time as new systems are built, but it will take many years before the existing stock would be \\nreplaced. Marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve results are presented in Figure 6-2. Maximum abatement \\npotential in the fire extinguishing sector is 6.4 MtCO2e in 2030. There are no emission reductions that are \\ncost-effective at prices estimated in this analysis. No reductions are available in 2010 as a result of the \\nassumption that the available technologies are only used for new installations and did not start to \\npenetrate the market until 2011. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-91 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n-$30 \\n-$20 \\n-$10 \\n$0 \\n$10 \\n$20 \\n$30 \\n$40 \\n$50 \\n$60 \\n$/tCO2 e \\n0 \\n1 \\n2 \\n3 \\n4 \\n5 \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n6 \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\nHFC AND PFC EMISSIONS FROM FIRE PROTECTION \\nFigure 6-2: \\nGlobal Abatement Potential in Fire Protection: 2010, 2020, and 2030 \\nIV.6.2 \\nEmissions from Fire Protection  \\nEmissions from fire protection equipment occur from equipment leakage, accidental discharges, and \\nuse during fire extinguishing. In general, fire protection systems have very low leak rates, except when \\ndischarged during a fire event. The majority of emissions associated with fire extinguishing come from \\nthe equipment\\u2019s use in the total flooding market (see Figure 6-3). Portable extinguishers\\u2014used most \\nfrequently in offices, manufacturing and retail facilities, aerospace/marine applications, and homes\\u2014also \\nuse HFCs, but such use has been limited (Wickham, 2003). \\nFor the purpose of this analysis, we considered the sector\\u2019s two types of fire protection systems\\u2014 \\n(1) portable fire extinguishers (i.e., streaming applications) and (2) total flooding applications. Typical \\nportable extinguishers contain 1.3 kg of HFC-236fa, which is assumed to be extinguished with a \\nfrequency such that emissions are 3.5%/year. The typical flooding application uses HFC-227ea; because \\ndischarge is infrequent, emissions are 2% per year. \\nFor modeling purposes, data typical for facilities in the United States are used. Certain cost \\nassumptions, such as capital and electricity costs, are adjusted for developing countries.1 Otherwise, it is \\nassumed that the costs and reductions achieved in the modeled facilities could be scaled and would be \\nrepresentative of the costs and reductions in other regions. \\n1 In developing countries, it is assumed that capital costs are 10% higher and electricity costs are two-thirds higher \\nrelative to those in the United States. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-92 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nStreaming \\nAgents, 47% \\nClass A Flooding \\nAgents, 51% \\nClass B Flooding \\nAgents, 3% \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n  \\nHFC AND PFC EMISSIONS FROM FIRE PROTECTION \\nFigure 6-3: \\nGlobal HFC and PFC Emissions in 2020 (% of GWP-Weighted Emissions) \\nIV.6.2.1 \\nActivity Data or Important Sectoral or Regional Trends \\nThe key activity data for fire extinguishing emissions is the consumption of the fire extinguishing \\nagent. Fire extinguishing agent consumption is assumed to occur in all countries and to scale with a \\ncountry\\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP); in addition, because there are no regional differences in \\nemission rates, emissions also scale with GDP. \\nGlobally, HFC and PFC emissions from fire protection have been growing because of the phaseout of \\nhalon under the Montreal Protocol. Because developed countries phased out the use of halon earlier than \\ndeveloping countries, the growth in global emissions for the past decade has been driven by emissions \\nfrom developed countries.

PFC Emissions from Primary Aluminum Production \\nIV.7.1 \\nSector Summary  \\nE\\nmissions of the perfluorocarbons (PFCs)\\u2014perfluoromethane (CF4) and perfluoroethane \\n(C2F6)\\u2014are generated during brief process upset conditions in the aluminum smelting process. \\nDuring the aluminum smelting process, when the alumina (Al2O3) in the electrolytic bath falls \\nbelow critical levels required for electrolysis, rapid voltage increases occur. These voltage \\nexcursions are termed \\u201canode effects\\u201d (AEs). AEs produce CF4 and C2F6 emissions when carbon from the \\nanode, instead of reacting with alumina, as it does during normal operating conditions, combines with \\nfluorine from the dissociated molten cryolite bath. In general, the magnitude of emissions for a given \\nlevel of production depends on the frequency and duration of these AEs; the more frequent and long-\\nlasting the AEs, the greater the emissions.1 \\nGlobal emissions of PFCs from primary aluminum production declined from 2000 to 2010, which is \\nlikely due to a variety of factors including improvement in process performance of existing smelter \\ncapacity, closure of high emitting facilities, and addition of low emitting new smelting capacity. \\nHowever, global emissions of PFCs from this sector are expected to increase from an estimated value of \\n26 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2010 to a projected value of 37 MtCO2e in \\n2030 (USEPA, 2012) (see Figure 2-1).2 This projected increase is largely the result of an anticipated \\nincrease in demand for primary aluminum globally over the same period that is increasing at a higher \\nrate than the assumed decrease in PFC emissions intensities (see Emissions from Aluminum Production \\nbelow). \\nFive different electrolytic cell types are used to produce aluminum: Vertical Stud Soderberg (VSS), \\nHorizontal Stud Soderberg (HSS), Side-Worked Prebake (SWPB), Center-Worked Prebake (CWPB), and \\nPoint Feed Prebake (PFPB).3 PFPB is considered the most technologically advanced process to produce \\naluminum and all new greenfield smelters built in the world today utilize this technology. Existing, older \\nand higher PFC emitting PFPB systems can further improve their anode effect performance by \\nimplementing management and work practices, as well as improved control software. Facilities using \\nVSS, HSS, SWPB, and CWPB cells can reduce emissions by retrofitting smelters with emission-reducing \\ntechnologies such as computer control systems and point-feeding systems, by shifting production to \\nPFPB technology, and by adopting management and work practices aimed at reducing PFC emissions. \\n1 It should be noted that over the last several years there has been the discovery and documentation of non-anode \\neffect (NAE) related emissions. USEPA has supported some of the most significant work on NAE emissions. These \\nemissions can be a significant, perhaps the major, source of PFC emissions in some smelter cells. It should also be \\nnoted that NAE emissions and NAE abatement measures are not addressed in this report. \\n2 Please note that IAI (2011) publishes a historical value of 24.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent \\n(MtCO2e) for 2010. \\n3 It should be noted that PFPB and CWPB are essentially same cell design, but with different alumina feed processes. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-103 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n0 \\n10 \\n20 \\n30 \\n40 \\n50 \\n60 \\nMtCO2e \\n48 \\n26 \\n31 \\n37 \\n2000 \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\nYear \\nAustralia \\nCanada \\nRussia \\nUnited States \\nChina \\nRest of World \\nALUMINUM \\nHowever, in practice, the greatest potential for reduction in PFC emissions is through addition of new \\ngreenfield PFPB capacity in concert with the shutdown of existing high emitting facilities.4 \\nFigure  7-1:  \\nPFC  Emissions  from Primary Aluminum Production: 2000\\u20132030  (MtCO2e)  \\nSource: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), 2012 \\nGlobal abatement potential in the primary aluminum sector is 22 MtCO2e in 2030, which represents \\napproximately 58% of the projected baseline emissions.

The country-specific aluminum production data described above is then disaggregated to cell \\ntechnology type using primary aluminum smelting technology mix information derived from IAI\\u2019s 2010 \\nAnode Effects Survey Report (IAI, 2011). For countries where future production is anticipated to be greater \\nthan the nameplate capacity in 2010, the excess production is assigned to PFPB technology. All current \\nand future production in China is also assumed to be PFPB technology. \\nNew primary aluminum production is increasingly taking place in emerging and developing regions, \\nincluding China and the Middle East, and other countries, including Iceland, where there is the \\navailability of long term, economically attractive power. New facilities open using new, less emissive \\nPFPB technologies. In addition, over time older facilities, which use older, more emissive technologies, \\nare likely to close, especially if they do not have continued access to competitive power (and labor) \\nagreements. For example, China is anticipated to continue to be the major primary aluminum producer, \\nand now uses PFPB technology across all of its facilities.8 Other high-production countries use a mix of \\ntechnology types, and production in some of these countries is anticipated to grow, while production in \\nothers is expected to remain constant. For example, after 2015, the United States is anticipated to no \\nlonger be a top five producer of primary aluminum. Thus, emissions in countries with new production \\nare likely to grow more slowly than emissions from countries with existing production given similar \\nincreases in the rate of primary aluminum produced. \\nIV.7.2.2 \\nEmission Estimates and Related Assumptions \\nAs previously mentioned, global emissions of PFCs from primary aluminum production are estimate \\nas 26 MtCO2e in 2010, and are projected to grow to 37 MtCO2e in 2030. Emissions from aluminum \\nproduction can generally be described in terms of historical emissions and projected emissions. \\nHistorical, global, PFC emissions data for 1990 through 2010 are compiled from data provided by the IAI \\nin 2010 Anode Effects Survey Report (IAI, 2011). Projected, country-specific, PFC emissions data for 2010 \\nthrough 2030 are estimated based on the product of the country-specific production by cell technology \\ntype and the technology-specific mean emission factor for the respective year. \\nTable 7-1 shows the top countries and regional breakout of emissions of PFCs from primary \\naluminum production from 2010 to 2030. \\n7 It should be noted that growth rates in primary aluminum production have exceeded this value over the past \\ndecade\\u2014e.g., 5.3% this decade based on IAI statistics (see http://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/primary\\u00ad\\naluminium-production/#data)\\u2014and aluminum industry leaders have publically estimated growth rates of at least 5% \\nin the foreseeable future. Growth rates in aluminum production have historically tracked GDP growth in developed \\ncountries, and aluminum growth rates have been historically greater than GDP growth in developing countries based \\non the need for aluminum in infrastructure and transportation development. In addition, production growth rates \\nare region specific, and consumption is not driven by an average (mean) global GDP growth.

Minor \\nretrofits can be performed at any facility type other than the state-of-the-art PFPB facilities. For the \\npurpose of the cost analysis, a minor retrofit has a lifetime of 10 years for VSS, HSS, and SWPB facility \\ntypes; 20 years at the CWPB facility; and 30 years at the PFPB facilities, based on expert judgment.

The additional operating costs \\nwere assumed to equal the percentage increase in current efficiency multiplied by the capital \\ncosts of the retrofit, which is the method used to estimate O&M costs by IEA (2000). These costs \\nrange from approximately $60,000 to $120,000 (2010 USD), depending on the facility type. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Revenue: Based on expert judgment, it is assumed that the increased current efficiency \\n(aluminum production/unit of electricity) resulting from the retrofits would be used by the model \\nfacilities to produce more aluminum with the same amount of electricity consumption as before \\n(rather than producing the previous levels of aluminum production and realizing the electricity \\nsavings).13 Consequently, additional revenues of approximately $0.5 million to $1 million (2010 \\nUSD) are associated with the minor retrofit option, depending on the facility type. \\n\\u2022  \\nTechnical Lifetime: The expected lifetime range is assumed to be 10 years for VSS, HSS, and \\nSWPB facility types.

However, in the \\ncase of PFPB technology, the universe of facilities using this technology is further subdivided into state-\\nof-the-art (i.e., newer) PFPB facilities for which no abatement measures are applicable and other (i.e., \\nolder) PFPB facilities for which certain abatement measures are an option. The performance for state-of\\u00ad\\nthe-art (as opposed to other) PFPB technology is therefore better represented by a PFC emission factor \\nless than the average (i.e., the median). Table 7-4 presents a description of the model facilities considered \\nfor this analysis. \\nIV.7.4.3 \\nAssessment of Technical Effectiveness \\nTo assess the abatement potential from each technology option, one additional parameter is needed, \\nwhich is termed the technical effectiveness. The technical effectiveness parameter determines the share of \\nemissions reductions attributed to each abatement measure. Similar to other industrial process sectors \\ncovered in this report, the technical effectiveness parameter is defined as the percentage of emissions \\nreductions achievable by each technology/facility combination. Estimating this parameter requires \\nassumptions regarding the distribution of emissions by manufacturing process (i.e., VSS, HSS, SWPB, \\nCWPB, and PFPB) in addition to process-specific estimates of technical applicability and market \\npenetration. The technical applicability, market penetration, and reduction efficiency assumptions are \\nheld constant for all model years. Table 7-5 reports the technical applicability parameters estimated of \\neach abatement measure/facility type combination. Table 7-5 also presents the market penetration, \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-111 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nALUMINUM \\nTable 7-4: \\nDescription of Primary Aluminum Production Facilities \\nFacility Type \\nDescription \\nVSS \\nThis facility uses VSS technology, with an average PFC emission factor of 1.01 metric tons \\nCO2e/metric ton Al.

HFC-23 Emissions from HCFC-22 Production \\nIV.8.1 \\nSector Summary  \\nT\\nrifluoromethane (HFC-23) is generated and emitted as a by-product during the production of \\nchlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22). HCFC-22 is used both in emissive applications (primarily \\nair-conditioning and refrigeration) and as a feedstock for production of synthetic polymers. \\nBecause HCFC-22 depletes stratospheric ozone, its production for dispersive uses is scheduled to be \\nphased out under the Montreal Protocol. However, feedstock production, a nondispersive use, is \\npermitted to continue indefinitely. \\nGlobal HCF-23 emissions are projected to more than double, growing from 127.9 million metric tons \\nof carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2010 to 286.4 MtCO2e in 2030. Figure 8-1 shows the projected \\nchanges in annual emissions of HFC-23 out to year 2030. China, India, and Mexico are projected to see the \\nlargest increases in HFC-23 emissions primarily because of increased HCFC-22 production capacity in \\nthese countries. \\nFigure  8-1:  \\nHCF-23 Emissions  from HCFC-22 Production: 2000\\u20132030  (MtCO2e)  \\nSource: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), 2012 \\nThe production of HCFC-22 in developed countries has decreased in the last decade, while growth of \\nannual HCFC-22 production in developing countries has grown substantially, driven primarily by the \\ndemand for its use as feedstock in fluoropolymer manufacture (Montzka et al., 2010). All HCFC-22 \\nproducers in developed countries have implemented either process optimization and/or thermal \\ndestruction to reduce HFC-23 emissions. In a few cases, HFC-23 is collected and used as a substitute for \\nOzone Depleting Substances (ODSs), mainly in very-low temperature refrigeration and air-conditioning \\nsystems.1 Several HCFC-22 production facilities in developing countries participate in the United Nations \\n1 Emissions from this use are quantified in the air conditioning and refrigeration chapters and are therefore not \\nincluded here. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-117 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n-$30 \\n-$20 \\n-$10 \\n$0 \\n$10 \\n$20 \\n$30 \\n$40 \\n$50 \\n$60 \\n$/tCO2 e \\n0 \\n50 \\n100 \\n150 \\n200 \\n250 \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n300 \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\nHFC-23 EMISSIONS \\nFramework on Climate Change\\u2019s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and through their destruction \\nof coproduced HFC-23, they are eligible for Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits. Such projects \\nwere approved beginning in 2003, and although currently 19 projects are approved, a large fraction of \\nfacilities producing HCFC-22 in developing countries are not CDM participants, in part because not all \\nHCFC-22 facilities are eligible to earn credits under CDM. Current CDM rules state that HCFC-22 \\nproduction facilities must have an operating history of at least three years between January 2000 and \\nDecember 2004 in order to be eligible for a project. A study published in 2010 reported that \\napproximately 57 percent of HCFC-22 were produced but not covered by existing CDM projects \\n(Montzka et al., 2010). In another assessment, approximately 43 production lines within 26 existing \\nHCFC-22 facilities were identified in Article 5 countries. There are about 23 production lines within 17 \\nfacilities in Article 5 countries with CDM Projects approved or awaiting approval (Hufford et al., 2012). \\nThis analysis examines the costs to mitigate HFC-23 emissions from HCFC-22 production plants that \\ndo not have incineration technology installed and the costs to mitigate HFC-23 emissions from those \\nfacilities that have thermal destruction devices installed because of a CDM project but are assumed not to \\nchoose to continue their operation after the CDM crediting period expires. There is uncertainty regarding \\nthe future of HFC-23 CDM projects and compliance carbon markets in general; the assumptions chosen to \\ndevelop projected abatement potential in this analysis represent one potential scenario. A discussion \\nregarding the limitations of this analysis is presented in Section IV.8.4 \\nGlobal mitigation potential of HFC-23 from HCFC-22 production in 2030 is 255 MtCO2e, roughly 89% \\nof the projected baseline emissions.

The analysis examines \\nfour possible categories of facilities. The first two categories address current and historical levels of \\nemissions from current facilities: \\n1.  Facilities with abatement controls in place already. This level of abatement is true for all production \\nfacilities in the Annex I countries and facilities that have CDM projects. Since the start of Clean \\nDevelopment Mechanism (CDM) projects for HCFC-22 production, there have been 19 CDM \\nprojects; the majority of these projects are at HCFC-22 production facilities in China (11 in total), \\nfollowed by India (5), Argentina (1), Mexico (1), and the Republic of Korea (1). \\n2.  Facilities with no abatement technology controls installed. Such facilities currently exist in China and \\nVenezuela. \\nThe third and fourth facility categories assist in projecting future emissions from current and new \\nfacilities: \\n1.  New facilities entering the market. To meet future global demand of HCFC-22, the analysis \\nestimates new facilities to enter the market once projected production for a non-Annex country \\nexceeds current capacity of the facilities within the country. New facilities are characterized as \\nbeing built without control technology. \\n2.  Facilities having previously participated in a CDM project, but not currently incinerating. When a CDM \\ncrediting period is over and the CDM project is completed, this analysis assumes that the \\nincineration device installed as a result of the CDM project will not be kept in operation. The cost \\nassumptions for these facilities differ from those of a new uncontrolled facility in that no capital \\ncosts will be needed to install the incinerator. This analysis assumes that all facilities participating \\nin CDM have completed their crediting periods by 2020. \\nIV.8.1.2 \\nActivity Data or Important Sectoral or Regional Trends \\nThe primary activity data for HFC-23 emissions from this sector are the level of HCFC-22 production \\nin the country and whether the production uses any HFC-23 abatement. A total of 20 countries produce \\nHCFC-22, and of this total, only 12 countries are assumed to continue to produce HCFC-22 between 2015 \\nand 2030. Regionally, abatement of HFC-23 emissions is occurring in developed countries, and in \\ndeveloping countries, abatement is driven by the CDM incentives for HFC-23 abatement. Thus, the most \\nsignificant regional trends are driven by assumptions about the extent to which abatement is occurring by \\ncountry and whether that abatement will continue in the future.

To account for thermal abatement technologies in the \\nbaseline, the analysis used a lower HFC-23/HCFC-22 production ratio. Depending on how well the \\nprocess is optimized, these ratios can range from 1.4% to 4% (Rotherham, 2004; McCulloch and Lindley, \\n2007). The emission rate for Annex I countries was assumed to be 2% across the entire time series \\n(Montzka et al., 2010). The emission rate for non-Annex I countries and Russia was assumed to be 3% \\nfrom 1990 through 2005 (USEPA, 2006) and 2.9% from 2006 through 2007 (Miller et al., 2010). The lower \\nemission rate takes into account any HFC-23 emission offsets from CDM projects in these countries and \\nthe Joint Implementation (JI) project at Russia\\u2019s HCFC-22 plant in Perm. Where UNFCCC-reported HFC\\u00ad\\n23 emission estimates were available through the UNFCCC flexible query system, these estimates were \\nused in place of estimates calculated using production data (UNFCCC, 2009). \\nHFC-23 emission projections were developed for Annex I countries including Germany, Japan, the \\nNetherlands, Russia, Spain, and the United States. For the United States, National Communications \\nprojections of emissions were used for 2010 to 2020 (UNFCCC, 2009); emissions trends were used to \\nproject HFC-23 emissions for the remainder of the time series (2025 through 2030). For all other Annex I \\ncountries, the dispersive production and feedstock production portion of emissions were projected \\nseparately to account for the decline in the production for dispersive purposes because of the phaseout \\nrequirements of the Montreal Protocol. To project the feedstock production portion of HFC-23 emissions, \\nUSEPA applied the 5% global growth rate of feedstock HCFC-22 production as reported in Montzka et al. \\n(2010). \\nHFC-23 emission projections were developed for non-Annex I countries including China, India, \\nMexico, South Korea, and Venezuela. To do so, non-Annex I aggregate HCFC-22 production was \\nprojected for both dispersive and feedstock production; the production was then disaggregated by \\ncountry using the percentage of each country\\u2019s contribution to 2007 non-Annex I HCFC-22 production. \\nEach country\\u2019s HCFC-22 projected production was then apportioned into four different model facilities \\nfor each developing country, and two HFC-23/HCFC-22 coproduction ratios were applied to develop \\nemission estimates\\u2014to address the varying use of abatement technologies by facilities.

For example, \\ndestruction of more than 99% of HFC-23 can be achieved under optimal conditions (i.e., a relatively \\nconcentrated HFC-23 vent stream with a low flow rate) (Rand et al., 1999). In practice, actual reductions \\nwill be determined by the fraction of production time that the destruction device is actually operating. \\nUnits may experience some downtime because of the extreme corrosivity of hydrogen fluoride and the \\nhigh temperatures required for complete destruction. This analysis assumes a reduction efficiency of \\n95%.2 \\nThe destruction of HFC-23 by thermal oxidation is assumed to be 100% applicable to all facilities, and \\nthe analysis assumes a project lifetime of 20 years. Cost estimates for installing and operating a thermal \\noxidizer are summarized below:3 \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Costs: The capital cost for a thermal oxidation system is estimated to be approximately \\n$4.8 million to install at an existing plant and $3.7 million to install as part of constructing a new \\nplant (Irrgang, 2011). \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual O&M Costs: O&M costs are approximately 2% to 3% of total capital costs (Irrgang, 2011). \\nThis analysis assumes an annual cost that is 2.5% of total capital costs for facilities with no \\nabatement technology control installed and just over 3% of total capital costs for new facilities \\nthat are entering the market. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Revenue: No annual savings or revenues are associated with the thermal oxidation \\nabatement option.4 \\n\\u2022  \\nTechnical Lifetime: 20 years \\n\\u2022  \\nReduction Efficiency: Thermal oxidation technology is assumed to be 95% efficient in abating \\nHFC-23 emissions. \\nIV.8.2.2 \\nEvaluation of Future Mitigation Options and Trends \\nThis analysis evaluates how thermal oxidation can be applied to facilities that are current CDM \\nparticipants after the crediting period is over and the CDM project is completed. Because an incineration \\ndevice is already installed as a result of the CDM project, the costs to adopt the abatement measure relate \\nonly to its annual operation. Facilities participating in CDM are assumed to have completed their \\ncrediting periods by 2020. \\nThis analysis also assumes that new facilities will enter the market to meet future global demand of \\nHCFC-22. New facilities are assumed to enter the market once projected production for a non-Annex I \\ncountry exceeds current plant capacities. According to industry, the costs of installing thermal oxidation \\nsystems in new plants are generally less expensive than the cost of installation at existing plants. This \\n2 A representative of a company that manufactures thermal oxidation systems stated that new systems are built using \\nmaterials that better resist corrosion than the materials used in older systems. The representative indicated that such \\nnew systems were likely to experience very limited downtime, considerably less than 5% (Rost, 2006). \\n3 Estimates developed for this analysis are based on communication with industry and best available industry \\nassessments; actual costs of some systems could differ from these estimates. \\n4 It should be noted that annual revenue is generated for participants of CDM projects; however, CDM projects are \\nnot assumed to be covering further abatement of emissions in this analysis. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-123 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC-23 EMISSIONS \\nanalysis uses a capital cost for new facilities that is approximately 23% less than the cost of installation at \\nexisting facilities (Irrgang, 2011). \\nIV.8.3 \\nMarginal Abatement Costs Analysis \\nThis section discusses the modeling approach and documents some additional assumptions used in \\nthe MAC analysis for HCFC-22 production sector. \\nIV.8.3.1 \\nMethodological Approach \\nThe MAC analysis applies the abatement measure costs discussed in the previous section of this \\nchapter at the three model facility types to calculate a break-even price for each option at each facility. As \\nmentioned earlier, this analysis developed four potential model facilities to model the mitigation \\npotential in this sector. These facilities included the following: \\n\\u2022  \\nResidual Emissions: These are facilities that have abatement controls in place already. All \\nfacilities in the Annex I countries and facilities that have CDM projects (mitigation projects \\nfunded by developed countries under the Kyoto Protocol) in the developing countries are \\nconsidered \\u201cresidual emission facilities.\\u201d \\n\\u2022  \\nNon-CDM and Uncontrolled Facility: Non-CDM facilities are existing facilities that are \\nuncontrolled. These facilities exist in China, South Korea, and Venezuela. \\n\\u2022  \\nNew Uncontrolled Facility: New facilities are assumed to be uncontrolled when built. It is \\nassumed that a new facility enters the market once projected production exceeds current \\ncapacity. In other words, the percentage of emissions from new facilities is 0% until projected \\nproduction exceeds capacity. It is assumed that new facilities will only be built in non-Annex I \\ncountries. \\n\\u2022  \\nPost-CDM Facility: Similar to the \\u201cless mitigation scenario\\u201d of Miller et al. (2011), this analysis \\nassumes that the 12 CDM projects that opted for a 7-year crediting period (in China, South Korea, \\nMexico, and Argentina) are not renewed after their first terms (note the remaining seven facilities \\nopted for a one-time fixed crediting period that cannot exceed 10 years). Please see Section IV.8.4 \\nfor a discussion on the uncertainty and limitations regarding this assumption. Under this \\nassumption, by 2020, all facilities previously controlled via CDM (\\u201cresidual emission model \\nfacility\\u201d) are considered a \\u201cpost-CDM\\u201d facility. It is assumed that the incineration device installed \\n(via a CDM project) will not be kept in operation once the CDM crediting period is over. This \\nanalysis costs out mitigation from these facilities differently than a new uncontrolled facility by \\ntaking into account that no capital costs will be needed to install the incinerator. \\nIV.8.3.2 \\nAssessment of Technical Effectiveness \\nThe analysis also developed a technical effectiveness parameter, defined as the percentage reductions \\nachievable by each technology/facility type combination. Market penetration rates vary over time as \\nsystems are upgraded in the future. Table 8-5 summarizes the assumptions regarding technical \\napplicability, market penetration, and technical effectiveness of thermal oxidation for each facility type. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-124 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC-23 EMISSIONS \\nTable 8-5: \\nTechnical Effectiveness Summary \\nModel Facility Type \\nTechnical \\nApplicability \\nMarket \\nPenetration \\nRate (2030) \\nReduction \\nEfficiency \\nTechnical \\nEffectiveness \\n(2030) \\nNon-CDM and uncontrolled facility  \\n100% \\n100% \\n95% \\n95% \\nNew uncontrolled facility \\n100%  \\n100%  \\n95%  \\n95% \\nPost-CDM facility  \\n100% \\n100% \\n95% \\n95% \\nIV.8.3.3 \\nEstimating Abatement Project Costs and Benefits \\nAbatement project costs discussed in the previous section were used to calculate the break-even price \\nfor implementing the thermal oxidation technology at each facility type (excluding residual emission \\nfacilities).

Table 8-6 presents the cumulative reductions \\nachieved at selected break-even prices. \\nThe results are driven largely by the designation of model facilities in different countries. For \\nexample, the United States and Russia have zero mitigation potential because they are included in the \\nAnnex I group of countries and were assumed to have 100% of their baseline emissions represented by \\nthe residual emission model facility (see Table 8-2). \\nFigure 8-4 shows the corresponding MAC curves for the six countries with abatement potential in \\n2030, which include China, India, Mexico, South Korea, and Venezuela. Total abatement potential is \\nachieved at break-even prices between $0/tCO2e and $1/tCO2e in 2030, hence the \\u201cL\\u201d shape of the curves. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-125 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n-\\n \\n\\u2013\\n \\n\\u2013  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n$/tCO2e \\n$60 \\n$50 \\n$40 \\n$30 \\n$20 \\n$10 \\n$0 \\n-$10 \\n-$20 \\n-$30 \\n0 \\n20 \\n40 \\n60 \\n80 \\n100 \\n120 \\n140 \\n160 \\nChina \\nMexico \\nIndia \\nSouth Korea \\nVenezuela \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\nHFC-23 EMISSIONS \\nTable 8-7: \\nAbatement Potential by Country/Region at Selected Break-Even Prices in 2030 (MtCO2e) \\nBreak Even Price ($/tCO2e) \\nCountry/Region \\n10 \\n5 \\n0  \\n5  \\n10 \\n15 \\n20 \\n30 \\n50 \\n100 \\n100+ \\nTop 5 Emitting Countries \\nChina \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014  \\n139.7 \\n139.7 \\n139.7 \\n139.7 \\n139.7 \\n139.7 \\n139.7 \\n139.7 \\nIndia \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n79.5 \\n79.5 \\n79.5 \\n79.5 \\n79.5 \\n79.5 \\n79.5 \\n79.5 \\nMexico \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n28.0 \\n28.0 \\n28.0 \\n28.0 \\n28.0 \\n28.0 \\n28.0 \\n28.0 \\nSouth Korea \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n4.5 \\n4.5 \\n4.5 \\n4.5 \\n4.5 \\n4.5 \\n4.5 \\n4.5 \\nVenezuela \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n2.3 \\n2.3 \\n2.3 \\n2.3 \\n2.3 \\n2.3 \\n2.3  \\n2.3 \\nRest of Region \\nAfrica \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\nCentral and South America \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n1.6 \\n1.6 \\n1.6 \\n1.6 \\n1.6 \\n1.6 \\n1.6 \\n1.6 \\nMiddle East \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014 \\nEurope \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\nEurasia \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014 \\nAsia \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\nNorth America \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014  \\n\\u2014 \\nWorld Total \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n255.4 \\n255.4 \\n255.4 \\n255.4 \\n255.4 \\n255.4  \\n255.4 \\n255.4 \\nFigure  8-4:  \\nMarginal Abatement Cost Curves for Countries with Abatement Potential in 2030  \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-126 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHFC-23 EMISSIONS \\nIV.8.4 \\nUncertainties and Limitations  \\nThis analysis examines a scenario in which the current CDM projects, including those projects with \\nseven-year crediting periods, are completed by 2020.5 Whether project renewals will occur is uncertain; it \\nis also uncertain whether facilities would continue to abate even in the absence of CDM incentives. \\nAlthough the first seven-year crediting period for the South Korean plant in Ulsan, which ended in \\nDecember 2009, was recently renewed for another seven years by the CDM Executive Board in November \\n2011, the European Commission recommended in January 2011 that the EU cease the purchase of certified \\nemission reductions (CERs) derived from emission mitigation of HFC-23 production after May 2013 \\n(Europa, 2012).

F-GHG Emissions from Semiconductor Manufacturing \\nIV.9.1 \\nSector Summary  \\nTT\\nhe semiconductor manufacturing sector uses several fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-GHGs) \\nincluding sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), perfluorcarbons (PFCs) such as \\ncarbon tetrafluoride (CF4) and perfluoroethane (C2F6), and the hydrofluorocarbon HFC-23 \\nduring fabrication, a portion of which are eventually emitted to the atmosphere. In addition, \\nnitrous oxide (N2O) and several fluorinated heat transfer fluids (HTFs) are used in the sector, but \\nemissions from HTFs and N2O are not included in this analysis. \\nBetween 2000 and 2010 the production levels in the semiconductor manufacturing industry have \\nrapidly grown, and the complexity of devices produced has advanced substantially. However, over this \\ntime period F-GHG emissions from this sector have declined (see Figure 9-1). This reduction can be \\nattributed to ongoing mitigation efforts in response to voluntary emissions reduction goals set by the \\nWorld Semiconductor Council (WSC). For 2010, the WSC set a quantitative emissions target below the \\nbaseline level, and for 2020 it has set an emissions rate target which will entail further implementation of \\nmitigation technologies.1 \\nFigure  9-1:  \\nProjected Baseline  Emissions from Semiconductor  Manufacturing: 2000\\u20132030 (MtCO2e) \\nSource: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), 2012 \\n1 The emissions projection baseline used here is based on the projection presented in USEPA (2012). That analysis \\nwas conducted before the details of the 2020 WSC voluntary commitment were available. The projection assumes a \\ncontinuation of meeting an absolute emissions-level goal through 2030. Further analysis is needed to estimate future \\nemissions as a result of the new normalized emission rate goal set by the WSC, which will depend on future \\nproduction levels. More information on the specific assumptions in the baseline are available in USEPA ( 2012), and \\nmore information on the new WSC goal can be found at \\nhttp://www.semiconductors.org/news/2013/05/28/news_2013/global_semiconductor_leaders_reach_agreement_on_pl \\nan_to_strengthen_industry_through_international_cooperation/ \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-129 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n-$100 \\n$0 \\n$100 \\n$200 \\n$300 \\n$400 \\n$500 \\n$600 \\n$700 \\n$/tCO2 e \\n0 \\n2 \\n4 \\n6 \\n8 \\n10 \\n12 \\n14 \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\n \\nSEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING \\nSix mitigation technologies are considered which reduce F-GHG emissions from semiconductor \\nmanufacturing: thermal abatement systems, catalytic abatement systems, plasmas abatement systems, the \\nNF3 remote chamber clean process, gas replacement, and process optimization. Significant \\nimplementation of these technologies is included in the baseline projection as part of meeting global \\nvoluntary targets. The following mitigation analysis is intended to characterize further reductions beyond \\nthis level, meaning that reductions are fewer and more costly than reductions would be applied to an \\nuncontrolled baseline. \\nMitigation costs and potentials for a particular facility depend on a variety of factors including the \\nprocesses and gases used, and emissions reduction technologies already in use. The analysis in this \\nchapter considers mitigation technologies applied to two stylized facilities: one representing a \\u201cnew \\nfacility\\u201d with relatively new semiconductor technologies and processes and which has already \\nimplemented a suite of mitigation technologies, and one \\u201cold facility\\u201d which has relatively older \\nsemiconductor technologies and processes and limited existing use of emissions reduction technologies. \\nFull details on the model facilities are in Section IV.9.4.2. \\nGlobal abatement potential of F-GHG emissions in semiconductor manufacturing is estimated to be \\n12 MtCO2e in 2010, 4.6 MtCO2e in 2020 and 4.2 MtCO2e in 2030. These abatement amounts correspond to \\n67%, 23%, and 20% respectively in 2010, 2020, and 2030. Figure 9-2 presents the sector marginal \\nabatement cost (MAC) curves for these three years. The relative availability of potential further \\nreductions below the baseline projections declines in later years because more mitigation technology is \\nalready included in the baseline as part of meeting voluntary reduction goals. In 2030, less than 1% of the \\ntechnically feasible reductions could be supplied cost-effectively (at or below a zero break-even price), \\nand nearly 7% of those reductions would be achievable at a carbon price of $50/tCO2e. \\nFigure 9-2: \\nGlobal Abatement Potential in Semiconductor Manufacturing: 2010, 2020, and 2030 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-130 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING \\nThis chapter begins by providing a brief discussion of activities and sources of F-GHG emissions in \\nthe semiconductor manufacturing process, and presents the projected emissions from 2010 to 2030. This is \\nfollowed by an overview of the abatement measures available to the sector for achieving reductions, their \\ntechnological parameters, and economic costs and benefits. The chapter concludes with a discussion of \\nthe MAC analysis and regional MAC results. \\nIV.9.2 \\nEmissions from Semiconductor Manufacturing \\nSemiconductor manufacturing emissions considered in this analysis result from two main types of \\nmanufacturing processes used: the etching of substrates and the cleaning of chemical vapor deposition \\n(CVD) chambers. In addition to direct emissions of portions of F-GHGs that are not consumed in these \\nprocesses, by-product emissions of CF4 and other gases (e.g., C2F6) occur when a fraction of the gases \\nused in processes react to form other F-GHGs. \\nOther than etching and chamber cleaning, at least three other semiconductor manufacturing \\nprocesses result in greenhouse gas emissions. This includes the use of F-GHGs in cleaning wafers, the use \\nof nitrous oxide in chemical vapor deposition and other processes, and the use of fluorinated heat \\ntransfer fluids. However, these emitting processes were not considered in this analysis because there is \\nvery limited public information that would make estimating emissions from them feasible. In the future, \\nif more quantitative information is gathered on these three emissive uses of F-GHGs, they can be \\nconsidered in an updated analysis. \\nFor the purpose of evaluating the cost of reducing F-GHG emissions from semiconductor \\nmanufacturing, this analysis considers the apparent differences in emissions resulting from newer and \\nolder manufacturing processes and mitigation practices; reduction costs for two typical fabrication \\nfacilities (fabs), which were generally characterized based on fab capacity (i.e., the number of \\nmanufacturing tools a typical fab may have); and the existing use of various mitigation technologies to \\netch and clean emissions. The emissions breakdown illustrated in Figure 9-3 represent emissions from \\nthese two types of fabs, further broken out by emission from etch and chamber clean processes. In 2020, \\nnew facilities are expected to make up 30% of global emissions, with old facilities accounting for the \\nremainder. A description of the characteristics of the old and new fab considered for purposes of analysis \\nis contained in Section IV.9.4.2. \\nIV.9.2.1 \\nActivity Data or Important Sectoral or Regional Trends \\nSeveral important industry trends drive changes in emissions and mitigation potential from \\nsemiconductor manufacturing: 1) rapid production growth, 2) evolving manufacturing processes and \\nincreasing complexity in devices produced, and 3) impacts of mitigation efforts resulting from voluntary \\nemissions reduction goals. These trends are described below. \\nBetween 2001 and 2011, global semiconductor manufacturing, measured on the basis of total \\nmanufactured layer area (TMLA), indicates a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% per \\nyear, which is higher than the silicon consumption growth rate of approximately 7% per year (VLSI, 2012 \\nand WFF, 2012).2 Both silicon area and TMLA are metrics of semiconductor production; however the \\ndifference in growth rate is driven by the increasing complexity of devices, as TMLA reflects \\n2 Silicon consumption was taken from VLSI, 2012. TMLA was derived in the EPA PFC Emissions Vintaging Model \\nusing data from VLSI, 2012 and WFF, 2012. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-131 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nclean, new, \\n14% \\netch, \\nnew, 16% \\nclean, \\nold, \\n55% \\netch, old, \\n15% \\nSEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING \\nFigure 9-3: \\nGlobal F-GHG Emissions in 2020 by Fab Type and Process (% of GWP-Weighted Emissions) \\nthe silicon wafer base layer plus all the metal interconnect layers and the silicon consumption reflects just \\nthe base. More recently production growth has slowed. Between 2006 and 2011, annual production \\ngrowth is estimated to be about 5% on a TMLA basis, or 4% on a silicon area basis. \\nEtch and chamber-cleaning processes have evolved as semiconductor technologies have advanced \\nand understanding of the emission pathways associated with manufacturing has improved. As \\ntechnologies advanced, the semiconductor industry used larger wafer sizes to increase to increase chip \\nproduction (e.g., 150 mm to 200 mm to 300 mm). Fabs that produce semiconductors on smaller wafers, on \\naverage, tend to be older and use manufacturing processes that result in a different breakdown of F-GHG \\nemissions from etch and clean processes as compared to newer fabs. Older fabs may emit approximately \\n80% of F-GHG emissions total from chamber-cleaning processes and about 20% of emissions from etch \\nprocesses. These percentages change to about 45%/55% clean/etch for newer fabs. This shift in the source \\nof emissions over time is a result of the following: 1) newer fabs generally are trending to NF3 remote-\\nclean technologies that result in lower emissions on a CO2e basis than traditional older C2F6- or C4F8\\u00ad\\nbased clean systems, 2) more technologically advanced etch processes have a significantly greater number \\nof steps, resulting in more F-GHG emissions, and 3) newer fabs can have less physical limitations on \\nusing abatement. As a new generation of fabs come online using 450 mm wafers, it is expected they will \\ncontinue to use NF3 remote clean technologies, abatement, and more advanced etch processes. \\nThe WSC set an absolute emissions reduction goal for 2010 and a further emissions rate reduction \\ngoal for 2020. The 2010 WSC goal was an emission reduction of 10% relative to 1995 baseline F-GHG \\nemissions.3 This emission reduction goal was met in 2010. Achievement of the 2010 WSC emissions \\nreduction goal has occurred in the context of significantly increasing underlying manufacturing activity. \\nA 2011 joint WSC statement reported that the participating industry associations had achieved a \\ncollective 32% reduction from their baselines while semiconductor industry production increased roughly \\nsix times over the same time period (WSC, 2011). \\nIn 2011, the WSC outlined a new voluntary F-GHG agreement for 2020 (WSC, 2011). This agreement \\nsets a normalized emission rate goal of 0.22 kgCO2e/cm2, which is a 30% reduction from the 2010 WSC \\naggregate baseline emissions rate (including China, which was not included in the 2010 goal) of 0.33 \\n3 Korea has a baseline year of 1998. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-132 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING \\nkgCO2e/cm2. In the 2020 voluntary goal the WSC also strongly suggests the use of best practices at newly \\nbuilt manufacturing facilities.4 EPA has not yet analyzed how this new agreement would relate to \\nabsolute emission reductions in WSC countries, however achieving this goal would require significant \\nuse of mitigation technologies. The baseline used for this analysis assumes continued production growth \\nand continued implementation of mitigation technologies; however it was estimated before the details of \\nthe 2020 WSC goal were available. Further analysis is necessary to estimate expected semiconductor \\nmanufacturing emission accounting for the 2020 WSC goal.

Instead, limited data on gas usage from the USEPA \\nVoluntary Semiconductor Partnership was used to calculate emissions in relation to production. \\nTherefore, emissions were estimated using this information, emission estimates from the UNFCCC, and \\nalternative activity data, which is production capacity. \\nAs described above, this analysis takes into account voluntary mitigation activities in the various \\nWSC member countries and assumes that member countries maintain emissions at the goal level in the \\nfuture.

This process is very efficient (using ~98% of the gas in a process) resulting in lower \\nemissions on a mass and CO2 basis than traditional in-situ chamber clean processes that use \\napproximately 20% to 50% of the gas in a process and have lower efficiencies (USEPA, 2010). \\n\\u2022  \\nGas replacement: Higher global warming potential (GWP) gases are replaced with lower GWP \\ngases, and in some cases more efficient gases (e.g., C4F8 may replace C2F6 in a traditional \\nchamber-cleaning process). \\n\\u2022  \\nProcess optimization: Processes are adjusted to become more efficient, using more gas within the \\nprocess, and thus resulting in lower emissions. \\nThese technologies reduce emissions from either etch or chamber-cleaning processes or in some cases \\nboth. Table 9-2 demonstrates the applicability of each mitigation technology to each process type. While \\nin reality some of these technologies can be stacked, or used together (e.g., a process can be optimized \\nand then abatement can be applied to that process), the cost and mitigation analysis does not model this \\nsituation. \\nTable 9-2: \\nSemiconductor Manufacturing Abatement Options \\nThermal \\nCatalytic \\nPlasma \\nNF3 Remote \\nGas \\nProcess \\nFab/Emissions Type \\nAbatement \\nAbatement \\nAbatement \\nClean \\nReplacement Optimization \\nReduction Efficiency \\n95% \\n99% \\n97% \\n95% \\n77% \\n54% \\nNew fab \\nEtch emissions \\nX \\nX \\nX \\nClean emissions \\nX \\nX \\nOld fab \\nEtch emissions \\nX \\nX \\nX \\nClean emissions \\nX \\nX \\nX \\nX \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-134 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n n/a  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING \\nTable 9-3 presents a summary of the engineering cost data for each of the mitigation technologies. \\nTable 9-3: \\nEngineering Cost Data on a Facility Basis \\nAbatement  \\nOption  \\nProject  Lifetime \\n(years)  \\nCapital Costs  \\n(2010 USD)  \\nAnnual Costs  \\n(2010 USD)  \\nAbatement Amount  \\n(tCO2e)  \\nNew \\nOld \\nNew \\nOld \\nNew \\nOld \\nNew \\nOld \\nThermal  \\nabatement  \\n7 \\n7 \\n$11,403,942  \\n$5,701,971  \\n$657,723  \\n$328,862  \\n10,497 \\n52,375 \\nCatalytic  \\nabatement  \\n7 \\n7 \\n$13,813,189  \\n$6,906,594  \\n$910,555  \\n$455,277 \\nn/a \\n11,851 \\nPlasma abatement  \\n7  \\n7  \\n$3,629,329 \\n$1,814,664  \\n$103,695  \\n$51,848  \\nn/a  \\n11,612 \\nNF3  remote clean  \\n22 \\n11 \\n$3,005,084  \\n$9,200,867 \\n$1,214,892  \\n$3,374,861 \\n1,166 \\n41,002 \\nGas replacement  \\n22  \\n11 \\n$1,180,000  \\nn/a  \\n$64,231  \\nn/a  \\n29,911 \\nProcess \\noptimization*  \\n22 \\n11 \\nn/a \\n$109,440  \\nn/a \\n($129,071) \\nn/a \\n20,976 \\nNote: Values in parentheses denote negative costs.  \\n*Values listed as capital costs for process optimization represent one-time labor costs, not cost of capital. \\nIV.9.3.1 \\nThermal Abatement \\nThermal abatement systems can be used to abate emissions from both etching and CVD chamber-\\ncleaning processes by heating process effluent streams to high temperatures to remove or destroy \\nF-GHGs. The use of thermal abatement offers the benefit of not affecting the manufacturing process \\n(Applied Materials, 1999); however, the systems do require space that may not be available in sub-fabs, \\nparticularly in older facilities. In addition, these systems require large amounts of cooling water, and the \\nsystem\\u2019s use results in regulated NOx emissions. Thermal abatement systems are currently the most \\nwidely used abatement system in the semiconductor industry. \\nThe engineering cost estimates for this technology are as follows: \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Costs: Thermal abatement system capital costs cover the cost of the abatement unit with \\nducting and water recirculation ($157,000 per unit), hook-up costs ($35,550), and natural gas \\ninfrastructure costs ($35,550) (Fthenakis, 2001; Burton, 2003). One unit is needed per tool at a \\nfacility. The total facility capital cost ranges from $11.4 million for new fabs to $5.7 million for old \\nfabs. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Costs: Annual operating costs per manufacturing tool, as presented in Table 9-4, are the \\nsame for both new and old fabs. Total annual costs (e.g., utilities) for a new fab are estimated to \\nbe $658,000 and $329,000 for an old fab. The higher capital and annual costs for new fabs are \\nbased on the fact that new fabs typically have larger manufacturing capacities (i.e., more tools) \\n(WFF, 2011). Annual costs per tool are summarized in Table 9-4. The per-tool cost is the same for \\nboth new and old fabs. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Revenue: No financial benefits (e.g., cost savings) are associated with using this \\nmitigation technology without outside policy or other drivers. \\n\\u2022  \\nReduction Efficiency: This analysis assumes a 95% reduction efficiency (Fthenakis, 2001; Beu, \\n2005; USEPA, 2009). \\n\\u2022  \\nTechnical Lifetime: Based on expert judgment, it was estimated that the average lifetime of this \\nsystem, and other abatement systems discussed in this analysis, is 7 years. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-135 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING \\nTable 9-4: \\nAnnual Cost per Tool for Thermal Abatement Systems \\nAnnual Cost Component \\nCost (2010 USD) \\nWater/waste water/maintenance \\n$2,370 \\nConsumables \\n$5,330 \\nElectricity \\n$2,610 \\nNatural gas \\n$2,840 \\nSource: Burton, 2003. \\nIV.9.3.2 \\nCatalytic Abatement \\nA catalytic abatement system uses a catalyst to destroy or remove F-GHG emissions from the \\neffluents of both plasma etching and CVD chamber-cleaning processes. This type of abatement is \\napplicable at most facilities, but there may be some space constraints as mentioned above for thermal \\nabatement systems. Additionally, because these systems are based on destruction via catalyst, they must \\nbe process/stream specific to achieve the 99% emission reductions quoted in the literature and used in \\nthis analysis (Fthenakis, 2001; Burton, 2003). \\nBecause catalytic destruction systems operate at relatively low temperatures, their use results in little \\nor no NOx emissions, and the required amounts of water are also low. Because of the high cost of catalyst \\nreplacement, these systems are the least widely used type of abatement (expert judgment). \\nCost estimates for this technology are as follows: \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Costs. Capital costs are associated with purchasing and installing the abatement systems \\n(Burton, 2003). One unit costs $217,010, and the installation costs $59,250, leading to estimated \\ncosts of $6.9 million and $13.8 million for old and new fabs, respectively. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Costs. Facilities incur annual costs per tool for water ($3,790), waste chemicals ($60), \\ncatalyst replacement ($12,580), and electricity ($1,780) (Burton, 2003). A new fab incurs annual \\ncosts for catalytic abatement of $910,600, and an old fab incurs costs of $455,300. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Revenue. No cost savings are associated with this technology. \\n\\u2022  \\nReduction Efficiency: The analysis assumes 99% reduction efficiency for catalytic abatement \\n(Fthenakis, 2001). \\n\\u2022  \\nTechnical Lifetime: Seven years. \\nIV.9.3.3 \\nPlasma Abatement \\nThese systems, which use plasma to remove or destroy F-GHGs, are applicable to etch processes in \\nmost facilities, with some physical space limitations. (These systems, though, are smaller in size \\ncompared with thermal and catalytic systems.) Plasma abatement systems use a small plasma source that \\neffectively dissociates the F-GHG molecules that react with fragments of the additive gas (hydrogen (H2), \\noxygen (O2), water (H2O), or methane (CH4) to produce low molecular weight by-products such as \\nhydrogen fluoride (HF) with little or no GWP. After disassociation, wet scrubbers can remove the \\nmolecules. The presence of additive gas is necessary to prevent later downstream reformation of F-GHG \\nmolecules (Motorola, 1998). \\nA plasma abatement system is needed on each tool chamber. The costs of plasma abatement systems \\nare developed using the following information: \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-136 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Costs: The plasma abatement technology requires capital costs that cover the purchase \\nand installation of the system, which total $41,500 per chamber, equating to one-time costs of $3.6 \\nmillion for new fabs and $1.8 million for old fabs (Fthenakis, 2001; Burton, 2003). \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Costs: Facilities with plasma abatement systems are estimated to incur annual operation \\ncosts of $1,190 per chamber, which includes general maintenance and use of the system. Total \\nannual facility costs are $103,700 for new fabs and $51,800 for old fabs, based on the assumption \\nthat there are 3.5 chambers per etch tool and varying numbers of tools for new and old fabs \\n(Fthenakis, 2001; Burton, 2003). \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Revenue: As with other abatement technologies, the use of plasma abatement systems \\nwill not result in any cost savings. \\n\\u2022  \\nReduction Efficiency: The emissions reduction efficiency of this option is estimated to be 97% \\n(Fthenakis, 2001; Hattori et al., 2006). \\n\\u2022  \\nTechnical Lifetime: 7 years. \\nIV.9.3.4 \\nNF3 Remote Chamber Clean \\nNF3 remote chamber clean is an alternative cleaning technology that offers the benefit of having a \\nparticularly high (~98%) utilization rate of NF3 (IPCC, 2006), resulting in relatively low emissions \\ncompared with traditional chamber cleans. NF3 remote clean systems dissociate NF3 using argon gas, and \\nconverting the source gas to active F-atoms in the plasma upstream of the process chamber. These \\nelectrically neutral atoms can selectively remove material in the chamber. The by-products of remote \\nclean include HF, fluorine (F2), and other gases, most of which are removed by facility acid scrubber \\nsystems. The use of NF3 remote clean systems is much more prevalent in newer fabs because the \\ntechnology was not available when many older fabs were constructed. \\nCapital costs for NF3 remote clean systems will differ for new and old fabs because of the \\u201creadiness\\u201d \\nfor NF3 remote clean installation. \\u201cReadiness\\u201d consists of having the current infrastructure (e.g., duct \\nwork, hook-ups) for system installation. It was assumed that old fabs are do not have the current \\ninfrastructure to use NF3 remote clean, whereas new fabs do. Therefore, the capital costs for old fabs \\nreflect the needed infrastructure changes for the fab. \\nCost assumptions include the following: \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Costs: Both facility types would incur capital costs for purchasing the NF3 remote system \\nand the additional necessary F2 scrub for use after the chamber cleaning of the waste stream. The \\ncosts for system purchase for a new fab are estimated to be $3 million. Old fabs are assumed to \\nnot be \\u201cNF3 ready,\\u201d or in other words, these facilities are not assumed to have the current \\ninfrastructure to handle the direct installation of NF3 remote systems. Therefore, old fabs also \\nincur capital costs, in addition to system costs, associated with investments such as gas hook-ups \\nand necessary hardware such as manifolds and valves in addition to the costs of the systems \\nwhich are assumed to be already installed at new fabs. (These costs are detailed in Table 9-5.) The \\nold fab costs are estimated to be $9.2 million. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Costs: Facilities operating NF3 remote clean systems are subject to annual costs that \\ninclude the purchase of larger volumes of gas (NF3 versus traditional chamber-cleaning gases \\nsuch as C2F6), general maintenance, and the cost of F2 scrubs to remove the highly explosive gas \\nfrom the effluent. Remote clean requires a lot of NF3, so much so that NF3 purchases are \\nestimated to comprise anywhere from 25% to upward of 75% of annual facility gas consumption \\n(expert judgment). New fab costs annually for NF3 remote clean are estimated to be $1.2 million \\nand to be $3.4 million for old fabs (Burton, 2003). \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-137 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING \\nTable 9-5: \\nCapital Costs per CVD Chamber for Making a Facility NF3 Ready \\nActivity \\nCapital Cost (2010 USD) \\nLabor/gas hookup \\n$3,980  \\nNF3 manifold, valves, etc. \\n$16,591  \\nToxic monitor \\n$7,700  \\nStainless steel line (double walled) \\n$10,310  \\nSource: Burton, 2003 \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Revenue: No cost savings are assumed to be associated with this technology. \\n\\u2022  \\nReduction Efficiency: The analysis assumes this technology offers a reduction of 95% of \\nemissions (Beu, 2005). \\n\\u2022  \\nTechnical Lifetime: Once the remote clean systems are installed, they will last for the lifetime of a \\nfacility. Based on information from the World Fab Forecast, the average remaining lifetime of a \\nfacility is 11 years for an old fab and 22 years for a new fab. \\nIV.9.3.5 \\nGas Replacement \\nGas replacement can be used to mitigate emissions from the traditional CVD chamber-cleaning \\nprocess. This method can be applied in most facilities and has already been used throughout the industry \\nin many instances. For this strategy, a lower GWP gas replaces a higher GWP gas. The most common \\nreplacement seen is using C4F8 to replace C3F8 or C2F6. In addition, the replacement gas (C4F8 ) is often \\nused/consumed more efficiently during CVD chamber cleaning than the original gas C2F6 or C3F8, which, \\ncombined with the differences in GWP, yields lower emissions. \\nAs with most other technologies considered in this analysis, there are no associated cost savings. \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital Costs. Facilities replacing C2F6 or C3F8 with C4F8 face a capital expenditure that reflects \\nthe aggregate cost of the C4F8 gas hook-up and an engineer\\u2019s time cost for implementation. Based \\non the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) number NM0317, the aggregated cost of \\nequipment, C4F8 gas hook-up, and an engineer\\u2019s time for implementation and installation is \\nestimated to be $1.2 million for old fabs (the technology is not assumed to be used at new fabs). \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Costs. Facilities face an annual cost that reflects the cost of replacing C2F6 or C3F8 with \\nthe more expensive C4F8. The costs of these gases, taken from CDM NM0303, are $35 per \\nkilogram of C2F6, $26 per kilogram of C3F8, and $72 per kilogram of C4F8.

Etch processes are typically \\ndeveloped to optimize production yield, and they are only adjusted to increase this yield; a company \\nwould not risk negatively impacting it (Beu, 2005; Fthenakis, 2001). Process gas optimizations for CVD \\nclean processes can be implemented because adjustments to these processes are much less precise than \\netch processes. There is room to reduce emissions without affecting yield. Optimization of clean processes \\nto reduce emissions usually results in small production gains but sometimes can result in large increases \\nin efficiency. \\nFacilities optimizing processes incur labor costs of an estimated $109,440; it is assumed that old fabs \\nincur this cost, while new fabs do not implement this technology due to their assumed use of NF3 remote \\nclean for the majority of clean processes. \\nDetails of the cost estimates for this technology include the following: \\n\\u2022  \\nOne Time Labor Costs: Facilities\\u2019 optimizing processes incur a one-time labor cost. Labor costs of \\n$43 per hour were used for a materials engineer in the semiconductor industry based on BLS \\n(2010) information and an estimated 2,560 hours of work, resulting in a total labor cost for each \\nmodel facility of $109,440. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Costs: No annual costs are associated with process optimization for clean processes that \\nare outside of business-as-usual (BAU) annual facility costs. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Revenue: Because process optimization involves adjusting a process to perform more \\nefficiently, the cost savings associated with this option are due to a lowered amount of gas \\nrequired to be purchased. For simplicity, the process considered in this analysis for this option \\nwas a C2F6 traditional chamber clean, and the related savings were estimated to be $129,070. As \\nfor the gas replacement annual cost, this number varies depending on the size of the facility. \\nHowever, consumption information was only able to be estimated based on USEPA Voluntary \\nPartnership data, in which facility age and gas consumption relationships were not \\ndistinguishable. \\n\\u2022  \\nReduction Efficiency: Observed reduction efficiencies for abatement of C2F6 in the literature \\nrange from 10% to 56% (Beu, 2005) and as high as 75% (Fthenakis, 2001).

The differences between \\nthese two fabs are discussed in more detail below: \\n\\u2022  \\nOld: The old fab is intended to capture facilities that use smaller wafer sizes, such as 150 mm and \\nbelow, as well as some older 200 mm manufacturing facilities (i.e., fabs built before 2000). This \\nfab is expected to use less current manufacturing processes and produce less, in terms of silicon \\narea. was estimated for this analysis, based emissions data reported through the U.S. EPA \\nGreenhouse Gas Reporting Program, that a typical \\u201cold\\u201d fab breakdown of emissions on a CO2e \\nbasis is approximately 20% etch emissions and 80% clean emissions. This is because older etch \\nprocesses involve less GHG-using steps and more commonly use traditional chamber cleans with \\ngases such as C2F6 as opposed to remote chamber cleaning processes. This fab is also expected to \\nnot use any abatement and only use minimal process optimization and gas switching. It was \\nassumed that an old fab has an average of 30 tools with 3.5 chambers per tool.5 \\n\\u2022  \\nNew: The new fab type encompasses facilities that use larger wafer, such as 300 mm wafers. It is \\nestimated, based again on emissions data reported through the U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas \\nReporting Program, that the total emission breakdown for the new fab is approximately 55% etch \\nemissions and 45% clean emissions. In contrast to the old fab, the new fab uses more recent etch \\nprocesses that have comparatively many more GHG-using steps and the fab has higher \\nproduction, in terms of silicon area.6 Another process shift seen in newer fabs is the trend toward \\nusing NF3 remote chamber cleans as opposed to traditional chamber cleans, which results in \\nrelatively lower cleaning emissions. New fabs are assumed to use NF3 remote clean mainly, and \\nhave abatement on all etch processes and all in situ chamber cleaning processes. It was assumed \\nthat new fab facility has about 50 tools with 3.5 chambers per tool. \\nThe emission breakdowns are essential to this analysis, because some mitigation technologies are \\napplicable to either both or just one type of manufacturing process. One other important factor is facility \\nsize. Newer fabs tend to have relatively larger production capacities than older fabs, and this difference \\nwas taken into account in this analysis. \\nThe facilities used represent two clearly defined and distinct types of facilities. These defined facilities \\nrepresent two existing scenarios, a better existing mitigation case and a worse existing mitigation case, for \\nsemiconductor manufacturing fabs. Given the variety of mitigation options, there are facilities that exist \\nthat may be in the somewhere between the two scenarios modeled. For instance, some fabs may partially \\nabate emissions as opposed to using full abatement or no abatement. These fabs were not explicitly \\nconsidered in this analysis due to the uncertainty associated with developing assumptions about their \\ncurrent mitigation practices. \\nIV.9.4.3 \\nAssessment of Technical Effectiveness \\nThe analysis also developed a technical effectiveness parameter, defined as the percentage reductions \\nachievable by each technology/process/facility type combination. Estimating this parameter requires \\nmaking a number of assumptions regarding the distribution of emissions by manufacturing process (etch \\nand clean) in addition to process-specific estimates of technical applicability and market penetration. The \\n5 CVD and etch tools generally vary between having three to four chambers. \\n6 Although newer etch processes are more efficient (i.e., gas utilization is higher) than older processes, the relative \\nnumber of GHG-using steps in more recent processes negates the potential benefit of higher utilization of gas when \\nconsidering overall facility etch emissions. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-140 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 0%  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING \\nsplit of etch to clean emissions is held constant for all years.

For example, fabs tend to use thermal abatement more than the \\nother technologies in their etching processes. In addition, it was assumed that because most new fabs \\nalready have NF3 remote systems in place less market share would go to gas replacement and process \\noptimization. \\nThe technical effectiveness estimates are then multiplied by the share of total emissions for each \\nfacility type to estimate the abatement potential achievable under each abatement measure. For the \\npurposes of this analysis we assume a 10/90 split in 2010 for the distribution of annual emissions coming \\nfrom new and old fabs. In future years, we assume based on expert judgment the share of total emissions \\ncoming from new fabs increases by 10% each year to account for the use of best practices by WSC \\nmembers, old fabs closing and changes in wafer size/technology demands. \\nIV.9.4.4 \\nEstimating Abatement Project Costs and Benefits \\nThe MAC model uses the estimated abatement project costs and benefits as described in Section \\nIV.9.3 to calculate the break-even price for each mitigation option at both new and old fab facilities. \\nTable 9-9 illustrates the break-even calculation for each abatement measure expressed in 2010 USD. \\nAlthough new fabs have lower break-even prices for thermal, catalytic, and plasma abatement measures, \\nold fabs have lower break-even prices for NF3 remote clean, gas replacement, and process optimization \\nbecause of their relatively smaller size.

However, emissions are expected to grow from the current level based on increased demand for \\nsemiconductors over the next 20 years, and this may be particularly true in light of the new WSC \\nnormalized emission rate goal The MAC analysis suggests that additional reductions from this sector are \\ncostly. In the absence of any external climate policy drivers, major reductions in the semiconductor \\nmanufacturing sector would require a significantly high carbon price (>$100/tCO2e) to incentivize \\nmanufacturers to adopt additional mitigation options. \\nIV.9.5 \\nUncertainties and Limitations \\nA few key uncertainties exist with respect to the analysis for the semiconductor sector. The extent \\nof current abatement is unclear; there is no comprehensive published information on the extent \\nabatement systems are really in use in the industry. In addition, abatement system reduction efficiencies \\nassumed in this analysis are really only achievable if the systems are properly operated and maintained, \\nwhich may not always be the case. Also, abatement system reduction efficiencies may vary by gas (e.g., \\nCF4 is harder to abate than other F-GHGs because of its relatively high thermo-stability, or bond \\nstrengths). Finally, the pace at which the semiconductor manufacturing sector has advanced has been \\nhistorically very fast-paced. This continues to be true, but it cannot be certain that this will continue to be \\ntrue given the continued rising costs of advancement. \\nThe limitations to this analysis are that it could not consider the full picture of emissions from \\nsemiconductor manufacturing (e.g., heat transfer fluid emissions are not included), and that the new \\nWSC normalized emission rate goal was not known at the time of the analysis. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-144 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING \\nReferences  \\nApplied Materials. 1999.

In the United States, SF6 recycling \\nis widely used, but there remains significant potential for reductions through other measures, particularly \\nimproved SF6 handling. In the developing world, SF6 recycling is rarely conducted; therefore, there are \\nsignificant opportunities for reductions from increased SF6 recycling in addition to significant reduction \\nopportunities from improved SF6 handling (NCGC, 2010; NEPA, 2005). The most cost-effective \\nreductions can be achieved by improving general SF6 handling practices at EPSs in the developing world. \\nIn these cases, the cost per ton is \\u2212$1.20/tCO2e. The most expensive emission reductions for the \\ndeveloping world are from implementing LDAR at $1.98/tCO2e. Opportunities to reduce emissions in the \\nUnited States are more expensive, expected to range from \\u2212$0.20/tCO2e for improved SF6 handling to \\n$9.40/tCO2e for equipment refurbishment. \\nThe manufacture of equipment for electrical transmission and distribution can also result in SF6 \\nemissions, but this type of emission is not included in this assessment. \\nThe global abatement potential in the EPS sector is 42.8 MtCO2e in 2030, which represents 67% of \\nprojected baseline emissions. This represents the maximum level of reductions that are technically \\nachievable by applying the four abatement measures in the EPS sector. For example, leak detection and \\nleak repair is assumed to have a reduction efficiency of 50%, and is applied only to a the stream of \\nemissions that occur due to periodic leakage; other options have a greater reduction efficiency, but no \\noptions are available to reduce 100% of emissions from all emission streams. Figure 10-2 presents the \\nglobal marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves charting the potential emission reductions in 2010, 2020, \\nand 2030. \\nFigure 10-2: Global Abatement Potential in Electric Power Systems: 2010, 2020, and 2030 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-148 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nVenting gas \\nduring \\nequipment \\nmaintenance \\nand disposal \\n24% \\nPeriodic \\nleakage from \\nequipment \\n9%\\nChronic leakage \\nfrom \\nequipment \\n23% \\nImproper \\nhandling of SF6 \\n38% \\nResidual \\nEmissions \\n6% \\n \\nSF6 EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS \\nIn 2030, approximately 7.5 MtCO2e, or a 12% reduction in baseline emissions, is technically \\nachievable at a break-even price of $0/tCO2e. At $5/tCO2e, an additional 28 MtCO2e may be reduced, \\nequating to a cumulative reduction of 56% of the global emissions baseline. The remaining reductions of 7 \\nMtCO2e are available at incrementally higher prices. \\nIn the following sections of this chapter, we first characterize the source of SF6 emissions in the EPS \\nsector and the trends driving future emissions projections. Next, we discuss the projected baselines from \\n2010 to 2030. This is followed by a description of the abatement measures\\u2019 engineering and cost \\nassumptions assumed for this analysis. Section IV.10.4 presents the additional assumptions used in the \\nMAC analysis unique to the EPS sector. The final section presents the MAC results in more detail and \\ndiscusses some of the uncertainties and limitations to the analysis. \\nIV.10.2 \\nSF6 Emissions from Electric Power Systems \\nEmissions of SF6 from electrical equipment used in EPSs broadly occur through two routes: \\nequipment leakage and handling losses. Leakage losses can occur at gasket seals, flanges, and threaded \\nfittings and are generally larger in older equipment. Emissions from improper handling can include \\nintentional venting to the atmosphere or unintentional venting, such as transferring SF6 between \\ncontainers and equipment using improperly attached or improperly sized fittings. Figure 10-3 presents \\nthe global distribution of SF6 emissions by emission stream assumed for this analysis. Leakage losses \\ncorrespond to periodic leakage from equipment (9%) and chronic leakage from equipment (23%). \\nImproper handling and venting losses correspond to venting gas during equipment maintenance and \\ndisposal and improper handling. The break-out percentages are based on assumptions used to develop \\nthe technical applicability of the options identified to mitigate these emission streams. \\nFigure 10-3: Percentage of Global SF6 Emissions in 2020 by Emission Stream \\n(% of GWP-Weighted Emissions) \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-149 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSF6 EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS) \\nThe amount of SF6 gas that each piece of electrical transmission and distribution equipment can hold \\nwhen properly insulated is referred to as \\u201cnameplate capacity,\\u201d which is measured in pounds or \\nkilograms of the gas. For the purpose of evaluating the cost of reducing SF6 emissions from EPSs, this \\nanalysis considers reduction costs for a typical electric transmission and distribution system that uses SF6\\u00ad\\ninsulated electrical equipment totaling 100,000 pounds of nameplate capacity. The system includes a \\nvariety of SF6-insulated electrical equipment (including circuit breakers, circuit switchers, and gas-\\ninsulated substations), although the vast majority of SF6 is contained in high voltage circuit breakers. \\nCircuit breakers within the system are assumed to be produced by ABB, Alstom, HVB AE, Mitsubishi, \\nand Siemens, with an equal proportion of breakers from each manufacturer. \\nThe analysis considers several possibilities for the maintenance and SF6 handling procedures used at \\nthe typical electric transmission and distribution system, reflecting different levels of emissions. For the \\npurpose of this analysis, the three types of systems include the following: \\n\\u2022  \\nResidual emissions system: In Europe and Japan, abatement options are close to fully \\nimplemented. Therefore, a residual emissions system represents an EPS containing SF6-insulated \\nequipment located in Europe or Japan. \\n\\u2022  \\nUncontrolled system: In contrast, abatement options have only been minimally applied or not \\napplied at all in most developing countries (Czerepuszko, 2011a; NCGC, 2010; NEPA, 2005; \\nRothlisberger, 2011a). Therefore, the uncontrolled abatement system represents an EPS \\ncontaining SF6-insulated equipment located in a developing country, which for this analysis \\nwould mean any country outside of Europe, Japan, and the United States.1 \\n\\u2022  \\nPartially controlled system: Abatement options have been partially to fully applied in the United \\nStates.2 The partially controlled system represents an EPS containing SF6-insulated equipment \\nlocated in the United States. \\nFigure 10-4 displays the breakdown of global emissions by system type as projected for 2020. For the \\npurpose of this analysis, the uncontrolled systems and partially uncontrolled systems are representative \\nof every system within their identifying regions. Therefore, the engineering cost results will not vary \\namong systems within the developing world or among systems within the United States. \\nIV.10.2.1 \\nActivity Data or Important Sectoral or Regional Trends \\nThe key activity data that drives SF6 emissions from EPSs is the amount of SF6-insulated electrical \\nequipment in use; this quantity is important for both leakage and handling losses. \\nHowever, data are not available on the total amount of SF6-insulated equipment currently in use or \\nhistorically in use at the country level. In the absence of such data, changes in the amount of SF6-insulated \\nelectrical equipment in use (both historically and in the future) can be estimated from the historical and \\nprojected changes in electricity demand at the regional level. This is because electricity demand is \\ncorrelated with the size of the electrical grid required to service that demand, and the size of the electrical \\ngrid is correlated to the amount of SF6 consumed by utilities within the region. Thus, the key activity data \\nused to drive emissions is electricity demand. Other important activity data include the characteristics of \\nthe equipment in use (such as age) to estimate leakage emissions and employee training and investments \\nin SF6 handling technologies to estimate handling emissions. In this analysis, these drivers are addressed \\non a regional level. \\n1 Australia and New Zealand are considered to have uncontrolled systems, which may be one limitation to this  \\nassumption.  \\n2 This system is also assumed for Canada.  \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-150 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nUncontrolled \\nAbatement \\nSystem \\n(Developing), \\n73% \\nPartially \\nControlled \\nAbatement \\nSystem (U.S.), \\n22% \\nResidual System \\n(Europe/Japan), \\n6% \\nSF6 EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS \\nFigure 10-4: Global SF6 Emissions in 2020 by Facility Type (% of GWP-Weighted Emissions) \\nAccording to EIA (2009), electricity demand through 2030 is projected to grow two to three times \\nfaster in developing countries than developed countries. \\nLeakage Emissions \\nOver the past 30 to 40 years, the amount of SF6 necessary for the operation of switchgear has declined \\nsignificantly and the tightness of equipment has improved. Such engineering design changes have \\nresulted in smaller leakage amounts and less frequent leakage over time (McCracken et al., 2000; \\nRhiemeier et al., 2010). The average age of SF6-insulated equipment in developed countries (including \\nEurope, Japan, and the United States) is considerably older than in developing countries. Until recently, \\ndeveloping countries were slow to adopt SF6-insulated equipment because of its relatively high cost \\ncompared with other traditional technologies, such as oil-insulated circuit breakers (Rothlisberger, \\n2011b). Also, the electrical grid in developing countries has grown rapidly over the last decade with \\neconomic growth, so the average age of all types of electrical equipment tends to be newer in developing \\ncountries than in developed countries, whose electrical grid has historically grown at a more gradual \\npace. The average SF6-insulated circuit breaker in developing countries, therefore, is assumed to leak less \\nthan the average SF6-insulated circuit breaker in developed countries. \\nHandling Emissions \\nEmployee training and investments in SF6 handling technologies (such as SF6 recovery carts) vary \\nwidely among countries and regions. The use of equipment and accessories to properly handle SF6 is high \\nin developed countries (Rothlisberger, 2011a) yet low to nonexistent in at least some developing countries \\n(NCGC, 2010; NEPA, 2005). Employee training is perhaps strongest in Europe, where the European \\nCommission requires that personnel who handle SF6 receive formal training and certification (EC Reg. \\nNo. 842/2006). In the United States, employee training has improved significantly since 1999 by \\ncompanies participating in the USEPA\\u2019s voluntary SF6 Emission Reduction Partnership for Electric Power \\nSystems, but, in general, training is not as rigorous as in Europe, and it is uncertain what level of training \\n(if any) has been instituted by companies not part of the USEPA voluntary program. Employee training is \\nlow to nonexistent in at least some developing countries (NEPA, 2005). \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-151 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSF6 EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS) \\nIV.10.2.2 \\nEmission Estimates and Related Assumptions \\nGlobal SF6 emissions from EPSs in 2010 were estimated to be 44 MtCO2e, which represents a 10% \\ndecrease from 1990 levels. This emissions decline, despite increases in the amount of SF6 in use over the \\nsame time period, was based largely on improved management practices and the retirement of old leak-\\nprone equipment in the United States and EU. However, it is estimated that emissions have increased in \\nrecent years because of the rapid increase in the amount of SF6-insulated equipment being used in the \\ndeveloping world without the application of SF6 abatement technologies and practices. These emission \\nincreases have been offset somewhat by the improved design of modern SF6-insulated equipment being \\ninstalled in the developing world.

Replacing existing SF6-insulated equipment with newer equipment that holds \\nless SF6 and is more leak-tight is another possible abatement option; however, this mitigation practice is \\nassumed to already occur in the baseline. Given that the investment to replace a circuit breaker or other \\nSF6-containing equipment can be as high as a million to several million dollars, it is not examined in this \\nanalysis for systems located in developing countries. All options are applicable to EPSs that are subject to \\nabatement (those outside of Europe and Japan). For the purpose of this analysis, four distinct emission \\nstreams were analyzed for the sector, and each emission stream can only be abated by one of the \\nabatement options (the abatement options are not capable of abating emissions for any of the other \\nstreams). Hence, the application of an abatement option to its unique emission stream does not affect the \\napplicability of any other options to their own emission streams.

For additional information on these technologies see Appendix K. \\nIV.10.3.1 \\nSF6 Recycling \\nThis option involves transferring SF6 from electrical equipment into storage containers during \\nequipment servicing or decommissioning so that the SF6 can be reused. Recycling is conducted using an \\nSF6 reclamation cart (commonly referred to as a gas cart). The gas cart recovers the SF6 from the \\nequipment and purifies it for future use; the recovered and purified SF6 gas can then be stored within the \\ncart, in a separate storage container, or transferred back to the equipment for reuse. Proper recycling \\ntechniques are documented in technical literature (CIGRE, 2005; IEC, 2008; IEEE, 2012). The alternative to \\nusing a gas cart is venting the used SF6 into the atmosphere and then replacing it with fresh SF6. Venting \\nis typically performed in areas where environmental consideration is low because the cost of purchasing \\nnew gas is often cheaper than purchasing gas carts and paying technicians to reclaim gas from \\nequipment. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-153 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSF6 EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS) \\nTable 10-3: Engineering Cost Data on a Facility Basis \\nAbatement Option  \\nProject Lifetime \\n(Years)  \\nCapital Cost \\n(2010 USD)  \\nAnnual Revenue \\n(2010 USD)  \\nAnnual O&M \\nCosts \\n(2010 USD)  \\nAbatement \\nAmount (tCO2e)  \\nSF6  Recycling  \\n15  \\n$479,560 \\n$67,994 \\n$5,372 \\n46,833 \\n$71,934 \\n$6,256 \\n$19,937 \\n8,618 \\nLDAR  \\n5 \\n$95,420 \\n$12,592 \\n$534 \\n8,673 \\n$91,485 \\n$3,476 \\n$6,339 \\n4,788 \\nEquipment \\nRefurbishment  \\n20 \\n$126,069 \\n$9,570 \\n\\u2014 \\n6,591 \\n$453,849 \\n$5,283 \\n\\u2014 \\n7,278 \\nImproved SF6 \\nHandling  \\n1  \\n$13,526 \\n$13,526  \\n$90,659 \\n$25,025  \\n$253  \\n$2,508  \\n62,444 \\n34,474  \\nThe SF6 recycling option addresses emissions that occur if SF6 contained inside equipment is vented \\ndirectly to the atmosphere, either because the equipment is undergoing a maintenance/repair activity \\nrequiring removal of the gas or because the equipment is being decommissioned. Based on expert \\njudgment, SF6 vented to the atmosphere accounts for 30% of emissions from uncontrolled systems (in \\ndeveloping countries) and 10% of emissions from partially controlled systems (in the United States). \\nSF6 recycling can reduce emissions by 4,320 pounds for the uncontrolled systems and 795 pounds for \\nthe partially controlled systems. The lifetime of this abatement option is 15 years (Rothlisberger, 2011a). \\nCost and revenue estimates for the SF6 recycling option are summarized below: \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital costs. The average total capital costs associated with the purchase of gas carts were \\nestimated to be about $480,000 for the uncontrolled system and $72,000 for the partially \\ncontrolled system.

Gas carts can range in cost from as low as $20,000 to as high as $175,000 depending on \\ntheir size (Rothlisberger, 2011a), and a mid-range gas cart size was assumed for both system \\ntypes in this analysis. The average capital costs for the partially controlled system are less than \\nthe cost per unit, because U.S. systems have implemented SF6 recycling to a greater extent and \\nfewer gas carts are needed across U.S. systems: less than one per system. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. O&M costs were estimated to be $5,000 for the \\nuncontrolled system and $20,000 for the partially controlled system. The lower O&M costs for the \\nuncontrolled system were driven by the significantly lower labor cost in developing countries \\nrelative to the United States. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual revenue. Annual revenue, which was estimated based on the reduction of SF6 emissions \\nmultiplied by the cost per pound of SF6 gas, was close to $68,000 for the uncontrolled system and \\n$6,000 for the partially controlled system. Annual revenues are significantly higher for the \\nuncontrolled system because the uncontrolled system has not implemented the option at all, \\nwhile the partially controlled system has implemented the option to 85% of its potential\\u2014 \\ntherefore the potential for reductions is greater. In addition, the cost of SF6 per pound varies \\nregionally and is relatively low in the United States (Rothlisberger, 2011a), so less money is saved \\nthrough reduced emissions. \\n\\u2022  \\nTechnical Lifetime: The technical lifetime of this option is 15 years. \\n\\u2022  \\nReduction Efficiency: The reduction efficiency for SF6 recycling is 90%. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-154 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSF6 EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS \\nIV.10.3.2 \\nLeak Detection and Leak Repair (LDAR) \\nLDAR is a two-step process. First, a leak detection technique is used to identify gas leaks from SF6\\u00ad\\ninsulated equipment. Leak detection methods vary and can involve simple techniques such as using soap \\nand water solutions to more sophisticated techniques such as those requiring cameras to visualize the \\nsource of SF6 leaks by exploiting the strong infrared adsorption of SF6 for detection. Thermal imaging \\ncameras allow the detection of even minor leaks without the need to take equipment out of service. The \\nabatement option analyzed in this analysis is the use of a thermal imaging camera. Identified leaks are \\ntypically repaired by applying a sealing material to the component that is leaking, although in some cases \\nthe component needs to be replaced completely. The International Council on Large Electric Systems \\n(CIGRE), published \\u201cSF6 Tightness Guide\\u201d (Brochure No. 430) offers details on more specific methods for \\nleak detection and tightness procedures and test methods (CIGRE, 2010). \\nEmissions addressed by LDAR occur when a piece of equipment periodically develops a manageable \\nleak from a specific component such as a bushing flange gasket. Once the leak is repaired, the equipment \\ntends to last months to years without another major leak. SF6 emissions from periodic equipment leakage \\naccount for 10% of emissions from both uncontrolled systems (in developing countries) and partially \\ncontrolled systems (in the United States) (Rothlisberger, 2011a; 2011b). \\nEmission reductions from LDAR were estimated to be 800 pounds for the uncontrolled system and \\n440 pounds for the partially controlled system. The lifetime of this abatement option is five years \\n(Czerepuszko, 2011a). Cost and revenue estimates for LDAR are summarized below: \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital costs. The capital costs associated with purchasing thermal imaging cameras were \\nestimated to be $95,000 for an uncontrolled abatement system and $91,000 for a partially \\ncontrolled system. The cost for a single thermal imaging camera was approximately $98,000 \\n(Czerepuszko, 2011a). \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual O&M costs. O&M costs were estimated to be $540 for the uncontrolled system and \\n$6,300 for the partially controlled system. The lower O&M costs for the uncontrolled system were \\ndriven by the significantly lower labor cost in developing countries relative to the United States. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual revenue. Annual revenue, which was estimated based on the reduction of SF6 emissions \\nmultiplied by the cost per pound of SF6 gas, was $12,600 for the uncontrolled system and $3,500 \\nfor the partially controlled system. Annual revenues are significantly higher for the uncontrolled \\nsystem primarily because it was assumed that the uncontrolled system has implemented the \\noption to a lesser extent than the partially controlled system\\u2014therefore the potential for \\nreductions is greater. In addition, because the cost of SF6 per pound varies regionally and costs \\nsignificantly less in the United States (Rothlisberger, 2011a), the cost of SF6 per pound is \\nsignificantly less for the partially controlled system relative to systems in other regions, and so \\nless money is saved through reduced emissions. \\n\\u2022  \\nTechnical Lifetime: The technical lifetime of this option is five years. \\n\\u2022  \\nReduction Efficiency: The reduction efficiency for LDAR is 50%. \\nIV.10.3.3 \\nEquipment Refurbishment \\nUnlike LDAR, which tends to focus on small leaks on specific components such as a bushing flange \\ngasket, refurbishment addresses the need for a comprehensive repair from equipment that chronically \\nleaks large amounts of SF6 gas. Refurbishment is a process in which equipment is disassembled and \\nrebuilt (and possibly upgraded) using remachined, cleaned, and/or new components.

Using LDAR only for this category of equipment also increases the risk \\nfor system reliability issues. Ultimately the equipment needs to be refurbished or replaced for these issues \\nto be solved. \\nBased on expert judgment, SF6 from chronically leaking equipment accounts for 20% of emissions \\nfrom uncontrolled systems (in developing countries) and 40% of emissions from partially controlled \\nsystems (in the United States). \\nEmission reductions from equipment refurbishment were estimated to be 600 pounds for the \\nuncontrolled system and 670 pounds for the partially controlled system. The lifetime of this abatement \\noption was estimated to be 20 years based on the assumption that the average lifetime of new equipment \\nwas 40 years, and the lifetime of refurbished equipment will be about half that of new equipment. Cost \\nand revenue estimates for equipment refurbishment are summarized below: \\n\\u2022  \\nCapital costs. The capital costs associated with equipment refurbishment were estimated to be \\n$125,000 for an uncontrolled system and $450,000 for a partially controlled system.

Improving SF6 handling involves both training technicians to \\nproperly handle gas and purchasing adapter kits that ensure proper fittings are available for connecting \\nhoses to all gas-insulated equipment throughout the system. \\nSF6 emissions from handling-related leaks account for 40% of emissions from both uncontrolled \\nsystems (in developing countries) and partially controlled systems (in the United States) (Rothlisberger, \\n2011a; 2011b). \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-156 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSF6 EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS \\nEmployee training and investments in SF6 handling technologies (such as SF6 recovery carts) are \\nmeasures that improve SF6 handling; several technical references are available with detailed guidance on \\nthe proper techniques for recovering, disposing and other handling practices of SF6 gas (CIGRE, 2005; \\nIEC, 2008; IEEE, 2012).

Table 10-6 illustrates the break-even calculation for each abatement measure expressed in 2010 \\nUSD. Improved SF6 handling is the only options with a negative break-even price, also known as a \\u201cno-\\nregrets\\u201d option because the benefits of adopting the abatement measure outweigh the costs of \\nimplementation.

Also, there is very limited information on the distribution of \\nemissions within a typical EPS because the system-level mass-balance approach (currently the standard \\nemissions monitoring method) does not track where or how emissions occur. The lack of reliable \\ncontinuous emission monitoring methods at specific points within EPSs also makes it difficult to \\naccurately monitor the reduction efficiencies associated with specific abatement options, so the reduction \\nefficiencies used for this analysis are based on judgments from industry experts rather than the studies \\ninvolving emissions monitoring. Much less uncertainty is associated with cost data because most cost \\ndata were obtained directly from industry representatives that provide the equipment and services for \\nabating emissions. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-162 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSF6 EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS \\nReferences  \\nCzerepuszko, P.

SF6 Emissions from Magnesium Production \\nIV.11.1 \\nSector Summary  \\nT\\nhe magnesium metal production and casting industry uses SF6 as a cover gas to prevent the \\nspontaneous combustion of molten magnesium in the presence of air. Fugitive SF6 emissions \\noccur primarily during three magnesium manufacturing processes: primary production, die-\\ncasting, and recycling-based production. Additional processes that may use SF6 include sand \\nand gravity casting, as well as wrought, anode, and permanent mold casting; however, these are not \\nincluded in this analysis. \\nBetween 2000 and 2010, global SF6 emissions from magnesium manufacturing have decreased 50%, \\nfrom 10 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) to 5 MtCO2e (USEPA, 2012). Over this \\ntime period, magnesium production has increased, but growth has been offset by major initiatives to \\nphase out the use of SF6 in magnesium production in numerous countries. As Figure 11-1 shows, from \\n2010 to 2030, emissions from magnesium production are projected to stay in the range of approximately \\n5 MtCO2e (USEPA, 2012). \\nFigure 11-1:  SF6  Emissions from Magnesium Production: 2000\\u20132030  (MtCO2e)  \\nROW = Rest of World  \\nSource:  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA),  2012.   \\nGlobal abatement potential of SF6 in the magnesium manufacturing sector is 5 MtCO2e in 2030, which \\nis approximately 98% of the projected emissions. Figure 11-2 presents the sector marginal abatement cost \\n(MAC) curves for 2010, 2020, and 2030. Three potential options are available for reducing SF6 emissions \\nfrom magnesium production and processing operations. These emission abatement measures all include \\nsubstituting SF6 with an alternate cover gas: SO2, HFC-134a, or Novec\\u2122 612. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-165 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n-$30 \\n-$20 \\n-$10 \\n$0 \\n$10 \\n$20 \\n$30 \\n$40 \\n$50 \\n$60 \\n0 \\n1 \\n2 \\n3 \\n4 \\n5 \\n6 \\n$/tCO2 e \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMAGNESIUM MANUFACTURING \\nFigure 11-2:  Global  Abatement Potential  in  Magnesium Manufacturing: 2010, 2020, and  2030  \\nThis chapter follows a structure similar to previous chapters, starting with a description of the \\nindustrial activity, facility types, and source of emissions, followed by a discussion of the projected \\nemissions out to 2030. Section IV.11.3 characterizes the abatement measures by providing a brief \\ndescription of each option and information on their costs and performance assumptions. The chapter \\nconcludes with a discussion of regional MAC results. \\nIV.11.2 \\nSF6 Emissions from Magnesium Manufacturing \\nUse of SF6 as a cover gas is the only source of emissions from magnesium production. Although \\nstudies indicate some destruction of SF6 in its use as a cover gas (Bartos et al., 2003), the analysis \\ndescribed here follows current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines (IPCC, \\n2006), which assumes that all SF6 used is emitted to the atmosphere. This analysis uses three model \\nfacilities to define magnesium production across die casting, primary production, and reprocessing \\n(recycle/remelt) facilities. Global SF6 emissions from magnesium production by facility type are shown in \\nFigure 11-3. Model facilities are based on industry data from the United States, but apply to magnesium \\nfacilities globally. \\nFor the purpose of evaluating the cost of reducing SF6 emissions from magnesium production, this \\nanalysis considers reduction costs for three typical magnesium production facilities\\u2014die casting, \\nrecycle/remelt, and primary production, which were generally characterized based on facility-specific \\ncase studies measuring average SF6 consumption, production capacity, and type.

Over this time period, magnesium production has increased, but \\nthis growth has been offset by major initiatives to phase out the use of SF6 in magnesium production in \\nnumerous countries. \\nFrom 2010 to 2030, emissions from magnesium production are projected to stay in the range of \\napproximately 5 MtCO2e (USEPA, 2012). Emissions from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \\nDevelopment (OECD) countries decrease substantially in the short term because of facility closures in \\nNorth America and SF6 phaseout efforts (U.S. Geological Survey [USGS], 2011). As a result, the OECD \\nshare of global SF6 emissions from magnesium manufacturing is projected to decrease from 40% in 2010 \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-167 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMAGNESIUM MANUFACTURING \\nto 12% in 2030.

Current SO2 technology research aims to improve process feed systems and control technology, \\nas well as to address the toxicity and odor issues with improved containment and pollution control \\nsystems (Environment Canada, 1998). The use of SO2 has the potential to reduce SF6 emissions by 100% \\nbecause a complete replacement of the cover gas system is involved. Currently, SO2 is being used as a \\ncover gas; for example, it is used as a cover gas at one diecasting facility in Brazil (UNFCCC, 2010). This \\noption is assumed to be technically applicable to all three model facilities. The maximum market \\npenetration for this option is assumed to be 80% of the emissions of SF6 for recycle/remelt facilities, and \\n10% for both die casting and primary production facilities. The lifetime of this option is assumed to be 15 \\nyears. \\nFacilities implementing SO2 as an alternative cover gas incur capital costs related to the cost for new \\npiping, pollution control equipment, and safety equipment for workers. The total capital cost was \\n$490,781 for all three facility types. Facilities also incur annual costs (or generate annual cost savings) \\nbased on the purchase price of the alternate cover gas. This option results in annual gas purchase costs of \\n$16,763 each for die casting and primary production facilities and an annual gas purchase cost of $74,833 \\nfor recycle/remelt facilities. SO2 is significantly less expensive than SF6, and the required gas replacement \\nratio is 1:1, resulting in a significant net savings in material costs. Replacing SF6 with SO2 also results in \\navoided costs of $131,633 each for both die casting and primary production model facilities and $588,018 \\nfor the recycle/remelt model facility associated with the purchase of SF6. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-169 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMAGNESIUM MANUFACTURING \\nIV.11.3.2 \\nReplacement with Alternative Cover Gas\\u2014HFC 134a \\nResearch has shown that candidate fluorinated compounds such as HFC-134a can be a cover gas \\nsubstitute for SF6 (Milbrath, 2002; Ricketts, 2002; Hillis, 2002). In addition, currently, HFC-134a is used as \\na cover gas at two diecasting facilities in Israel (UNFCCC, 2008a, 2008b).While fluorinated gases have an \\nadvantage over SO2 because they have potentially fewer associated health, safety, odor, and corrosive \\nimpacts, some current fluorinated gas alternatives (including HFC-134a) still have global warming \\npotential (GWP). However, the GWP of HFC-134a is significantly less than that of SF6: thus, the GWP-\\nweighted cover gas emissions could be reduced by 95%. HFC-134a is assumed to be technically \\napplicable to all model facilities. The maximum market penetration for this option is assumed to be 45% \\nof the emissions of SF6 for die casting and primary production facilities, and 10% for recycle/remelt \\nfacilities. The lifetime of this option is assumed to be 15 years. \\nFacilities implementing HFC-134a as an alternative cover gas do not incur up-front capital costs, as \\nuse of HFC-134a is a simple drop-in option and does not require additional/new systems or training. \\nThey incur annual costs (or generate annual cost savings) based on the purchase price of the alternate \\ncover gas. Use of HFC-134a results in annual gas purchase costs of $32,908 each for die casting and \\nprimary production facilities and $147,005 for the recycle/remelt facility. HFC-134a is not only less \\nexpensive than SF6, but additionally HFC-134a has a gas replacement ratio of 0.5:1, resulting in significant \\nnet savings in material costs. Replacing SF6 with HFC-134a results in avoided costs of $131,633 each for \\nboth die casting and primary production model facilities and $588,018 for the recycle/remelt facility \\nassociated with the purchase of SF6. \\nIV.11.3.3 \\nReplacement with Alternative Cover Gas\\u2014Novec\\u2122 612 \\nResearch has shown that candidate fluorinated compounds such as Novec\\u2122 612 can be a cover gas \\nsubstitute for SF6 (Milbrath, 2002; Ricketts, 2002; Hillis, 2002). Additionally, currently, NovecTM612 is \\nbeing used at one die casting facility in the United States. The use of Novec\\u2122 612 as an alternative cover \\ngas represents an advantage over SO2 because, like other fluorinated gases, Novec\\u2122 612 has potentially \\nfewer associated health, safety, odor, and corrosive impacts. Novec\\u2122 612 is a zero GWP gas and \\ntherefore has a reduction efficiency of 100% compared with SF6. Novec\\u2122 612 is assumed to be technically \\napplicable to all model facilities. \\nFacilities implementing Novec\\u2122 612 as an alternative cover gas incur capital costs related to the \\npurchase of computerized mass flow control cabinets and piping material to direct the gas. The total \\ncapital cost was $245,390 for the die casting facility, $33,128 for the recycle/remelt facility, and $496,916 \\nfor the primary production facility. Facilities also incur annual costs (or generate annual cost savings) \\nbased on the purchase price of the alternate cover gas. Use of NovecTM612 results in annual gas purchase \\ncosts of $60,754 for die casting and primary production facilities and $271,393 for the recycle/remelt \\nfacility. However, because the replacement ratio of Novec\\u2122 612 to SF6 is 0.3:1, significantly less Novec\\u2122 \\n612 is required to process the same quantity of magnesium. These costs are offset by the avoided costs of \\npurchasing SF6, an annual cost savings of $131,633 for both die casting and primary production model \\nfacilities and $588,018 for the recycle/remelt model facility. \\nIV.11.3.4 \\nSummary of Mitigation Technology Costs and Characteristics \\nTable 11-3 presents all of the data needed to calculate the break-even price for the options analyzed. \\nAll options have an assumed lifetime of 15 years. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-170 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMAGNESIUM PRODUCTION \\nTable 11-3: Engineering Cost Data on a Facility Basis \\nProject \\nLifetime  \\n(Years)  \\nAnnual  \\nSavings*  \\n(2010 USD)  \\nAnnual O&M  \\nCosts (2010 \\nUSD)  \\nAbatement \\nAmount \\n(tCO2e)  \\nAbatement \\nOption  \\nCapital Costs \\n(2010 USD)  \\nFacility Type \\nSO2 \\nDie casting  \\n15 \\n$490,781  \\n$131,633 \\n$16,763 \\n107,144 \\nRecycle/remelt  \\n15 \\n$490,781  \\n$588,018 \\n$74,883 \\n478,621 \\nPrimary production  \\n15 \\n$490,781  \\n$131,633 \\n$16,763 \\n107,144 \\nHFC-134a  \\nDie casting  \\n15 \\n\\u2014  \\n$131,633 \\n$32,908 \\n101,316 \\nRecycle/remelt \\n15 \\n\\u2014  \\n$588,018 \\n$147,005 \\n452,588 \\nPrimary production \\n15 \\n\\u2014  \\n$131,633  \\n$32,908 \\n101,316 \\nNovec\\u2122 612  \\nDie casting \\n15 \\n$245,390  \\n$131,633 \\n$60,754 \\n107,139 \\nRecycle/remelt  \\n15 \\n$33,128 \\n$588,018 \\n$271,393 \\n478,601 \\nPrimary production \\n15 \\n496,916 \\n$131,633 \\n$60,754 \\n107,139 \\n* These numbers are not net annual savings. \\nIV.11.4 \\nMarginal Abatement Costs Analysis \\nThis section discusses the modeling approach and documents some additional assumptions used in \\nthe MAC analysis for magnesium production. \\nIV.11.4.1 \\nMethodological Approach \\nThe MAC analysis applies the abatement measure costs discussed in the previous section of this \\nchapter at three magnesium production facility types to calculate a break-even price for each option at \\neach facility (i.e., die casting, recycle/remelt, and primary production). This section presents detailed \\ninformation on how each type of facility was defined in this analysis and detailed information on how \\ncosts were built out for each mitigation technology. \\nIV.11.4.2 \\nModel Facilities Defined \\nThe break-even cost analysis is conducted on three model facility types defined as follows: \\n\\u2022  \\nDie casting facility\\u2014Represents medium-sized facility currently in production in the United \\nStates where abatement option was implemented in 2008. Annual production is assumed to be 26 \\nkilo tons. The annual SF6 usage rate was 0.17kg/ ton produced (based on data reported by facility \\nunder USEPA SF6 Emission Reduction Partnership). This emission factor multiplied by the \\nannual production of magnesium yields annual facility emissions of approximately 4.4 tons of \\nSF6 (equal to 107,550 tCO2e). \\n\\u2022  \\nRecycle/Remelt facility\\u2014Represents medium-sized facility currently in production in the United \\nStates where abatement option was implemented in 2008. Production data is from 2007, prior to \\nimplementation of abatement option. Annual production is assumed to be 18 kilo tons. The \\nannual SF6 usage rate was 1.09 kg/ ton of magnesium produced (based on data reported by \\nfacility under USEPA SF6 Emission Reduction Partnership). This emission factor multiplied by \\nthe annual production yields annual facility emissions of approximately 20 tons of SF6. \\n\\u2022  \\nPrimary production facility\\u2014Assumes similar characteristics as the die casting model facility. \\nAnnual magnesium production is 26 kilotons and a SF6 usage rate of 0.17 kg/ton of production. \\nThe model primary production facility annual emissions are 4.4 tons of SF6. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-171 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMAGNESIUM MANUFACTURING \\nIV.11.4.3 \\nAssessment of Technical Effectiveness \\nFor this analysis, we developed a technical effectiveness parameter, defined as the percentage \\nreductions achievable by each technology/facility-type combination.

Market penetration rates were assumed based on expert judgment. \\nFor example, for die casting facility experts believe that a facility would adopt both NovecTM612 and \\nHFC-134a over SO2, with an equal chance of adopting either NovecTM612 or HFC-134a. The same \\nassumptions were made for a primary production facility. For recycle/remelt facility, experts believed \\nthat there would be a preference for SO2 over the other two alternative cover gases, with an equal chance \\nof adopting either NovecTM612 or HFC-134a. Multiplying the technical applicability, market penetration, \\nand reduction efficiency for each alternative cover gas at each facility type produces the technical \\neffectiveness estimates for each facility type. These assumptions are held constant for all model years. \\nIV.11.4.4 \\nEstimating Abatement Project Costs and Benefits \\nThe MAC model uses the estimated abatement project costs and benefits as described in Section \\nIV.11.3 to calculate the break-even price for each mitigation option at each model facility. Table 11-5 \\nillustrates the break-even calculation for each abatement measure expressed in 2010 USD. Die casting and \\nrecycle facility types have negative break-even prices for all three abatement measures. The only positive \\nbreak-even price estimated was for alternate cover gas\\u2014NovecTM 612 when applied to the primary \\nproduction facility due to a higher initial capital cost compared with other facility types.

Emissions from Photovoltaic Cell Manufacturing \\nIV.12.1 \\nSector Summary  \\nT\\nhe photovoltaic (PV) cell manufacturing process can use multiple fluorinated greenhouse gases \\n(F-GHGs) \\nduring \\nproduction, \\nincluding \\nnitrogen \\ntrifluoride \\n(NF3) \\nand \\nthe \\nperfluorocompounds (PFCs) carbon tetrafluoride (CF4) and perfluoroethane (C2F6,). During the \\nmanufacture of PV cells some of the F-GHGs not used in processes are released to the atmosphere. \\nF-GHG emissions from PV cell manufacturing are estimated to be approximately 2.3 million metric \\ntons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MtCO2e) in 2010. As Figure 12-1 shows, by 2030, emissions from the \\nmanufacturing of PV cells are expected to decrease to 1.9 MtCO2e. The baseline projections presented \\nhere are updated relative to those presented in Global Anthropogenic Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: \\n1990 to 2030 (USEPA, 2012). The updates incorporate new market information which has resulted in \\nsignificantly lower emission estimates. The decrease in emissions can be attributed to lower expected \\ngrowth in production and lower fraction of production assumed to use F-GHGs. Emissions projections \\nfor this sector are particularly uncertain to due limited information on emissions rates, use of fluorinated \\ngases, production growth rates, and policies to encourage renewable energy development. \\nFigure 12-1: F-GHG Emissions from PV Cell Manufacturing: 2000\\u20132030 (MtCO2e) \\nSource: Update of projections presented in USEPA, 2012. \\nFour mitigation technologies were considered in this analysis as options for reducing F-GHG \\nemissions from PV manufacturing: thermal abatement systems, catalytic abatement systems, plasmas \\nabatement systems, and the NF3 remote chamber clean process. Due to the lack of mitigation cost \\ninformation specific to PV production, data is drawn from experience reducing emissions from similar \\nprocesses in semiconductor manufacturing. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-177 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n$0 \\n$100 \\n$200 \\n$300 \\n$400 \\n$500 \\n$600 \\n$700 \\n$800 \\n$900 \\n0.0 \\n0.5 \\n1.0 \\n1.5 \\n2.0 \\n$/tCO2e \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n2.5 \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\nPHOTOVOLTAIC CELL MANUFACTURING \\nThe marginal abatement cost (MAC) analysis estimates a global mitigation potential of 1.7 MtCO2e, \\nbased on the four abatement measures. The abatement potential represents 90% of the projected \\nemissions in 2030. Figure 12-2 presents the global MAC curves for 2010, 2020, and 2030 for the PV \\nmanufacturing sector. \\nFigure 12-2: Global Abatement Potential in PV Cell Manufacturing: 2010, 2020, and 2030 \\nHigh capital costs and relatively low emissions reduction amounts result in relatively high break-\\neven prices for abatement measures in the PV manufacturing sector relative to other industrial process \\nsectors. As a result, break-even prices in this sector are all greater than $120/tCO2e. \\nThe following sections of this chapter first describe the activities and sources of F-GHG emissions in \\nthe PV manufacturing sector and present the projected emissions for 2010 to 2030. Subsequent sections \\ncharacterize the four abatement measures considered and present the engineering cost assumptions used \\nin the MAC analysis. This is followed by a discussion of the MAC modeling assumptions that were used \\nto estimate the global abatement potential. We conclude the chapter by presenting the MAC curves for a \\nselect number of individual countries and discuss some of the major uncertainties and limitations. \\nIV.12.2 \\nEmissions from Photovoltaic Cell Manufacturing \\nPV manufacturing may use F-GHGs, thereby resulting in F-GHG emissions, including CF4, C2F6, and \\nNF3, from etching and chamber cleaning processes used during the manufacture of PV cells. Etching is \\ndone on various substrates, including crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, and other thin-films. CF4 and \\nC2F6 are used during the manufacture of some crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV cells, and NF3 is used during \\nthe manufacture of amorphous silicon (a-Si) and tandem a-Si/nanocrystaline (nc) silicon PV cells. \\nHowever, not all poly-silicon manufacturing process use F-GHGs, this was taken into consideration in the \\nanalysis. Processes for PV cells manufactured on other thin films do not require the use of GHGs; \\ntherefore, these processes were not considered in this analysis. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-178 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\nEtch, \\n10% \\nClean, 90% \\nPHOTOVOLTAIC CELL MANUFACTURING \\nThe emission estimates presented in Figure 12-1 represent a piece of the total life cycle emissions \\nassociated with manufacturing PV cells. One motivation of using PV cells is the production of reliable \\nlow carbon energy, so it is not only important to consider the life cycle GHG emissions but also to \\nconsider the benefits from using PV cells versus traditional fossil generated power. The European \\nPhotovoltaic Industry Association (EPIA) analyzed the life cycle of a PV cell (from material sourcing, \\nthrough manufacturing, transportation, construction, operation, dismantling and to product collection \\nand recycling into account) and estimated that \\u201cThe carbon footprint of PV systems\\u2014assuming a location \\nin southern Europe\\u2014ranges from 16 to 32 gCO2 eq. per kWh compared to between 300 and 1000 g CO2 \\neq. per kWh when produced from fossil fuels.\\u201d EPIA also estimates that solar power will still have a \\ncarbon footprint of 10 to 20 times less than traditional fossil-based power with carbon capture and \\nstorage. While solar power is a good low-carbon alternative to fossil based power and over the lifetime of \\nthe cell it has climate benefits over traditional power sources, there is still potential to make it even more \\nbeneficial. According to EPIA \\u201cThe carbon footprint of PV has decreased by approximately 50% in the \\nlast 10 years thanks to performance improvements, raw material savings and manufacturing process \\nimprovements\\u201d (EPIA, 2011). Implementing PFC and NF3 mitigation strategies offers an opportunity to \\nfurther decrease the carbon footprint of PV cells, particularly given the high potency of these gases. \\nTo evaluate the cost of reducing F-GHG emissions from the manufacture of PV cells, this analysis \\nconsiders the emissions and reduction costs for a typical PV manufacturing facility, characterized based \\non an average facility capacity and the applicability of various mitigation technologies to etch and clean \\nemissions. The facility has an average capacity of 80 megawatts (MW) with an estimated 25 tools with 3.5 \\nchambers. The facility uses only three F-GHGs: CF4, C2F6, and NF3.1 Figure 12-3 shows the breakdown of \\netch and clean emissions for the typical facility. \\nFigure 12-3: Global F-GHG Emissions in 2020 by Facility Type (% of GWP-Weighted Emissions) \\n1 Although these gases are used for different PV technologies, for simplicity in this analysis, one general facility \\nproducing an unidentifiable PV technology was considered. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-179 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nPHOTOVOLTAIC CELL MANUFACTURING \\nIV.12.2.1 \\nActivity Data and Important Sectoral/Regional Trends \\nSeveral industry trends which will influence future emissions from this sector include the rate of \\ngrowth in PV panel production, the overall penetration of PV into the global energy market, and the \\nrelative proportion of various PV technologies with different rates of F-gas usage or emissions rates. \\nCurrent market trends indicate an increase and then a dip in production, and therefore, increases \\nfollowed by decreases in annual emissions. Despite many slowing sectors because of the global economic \\nslowdown, the PV sector continued to exceed expected growth rates while other sectors saw slowdowns. \\nAccording to the Global Market Outlook for Photovoltaics Until 2016, the main reasons for the large historic \\nand continued growth in the PV sector are: 1. \\u201cRenewable energy has continued to prove itself to be a \\nmainstream energy source and a significant contributor to achieving energy, environmental and \\neconomic goals\\u201d; 2. \\u201cSome countries have increased their focus on renewable energy standards in the \\nwake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, requiring them to consider new policies that move the market in \\nthis direction\\u201d; 3. \\u201cPV modules have undergone significant price decreases\\u2026\\u201d; and 4. \\u201cIn some countries, \\nquestions about the future of support-scheme levels has produced boom-and-bust cycles.\\u201d Also, many \\ncountries are just starting to tap into the installed potential for PV. These factors account for the fact that \\nthere was large general growth across all regions of the world. However, in 2012, the Congressional \\nResearch Service noted that \\u201cThe creation of incentives for solar installations in several countries around \\n2004 led many companies to enter the PV industry. According to an estimate by Photon International, \\nmore than 1,000 PV module manufacturers worldwide supplied the market in 2011. But with demand in \\nsome countries declining and prices weak, the industry appears to have entered a phase of rapid \\nconsolidation on a global basis\\u201d (CRS, 2012). \\nThe world saw booms in PV cell manufacturing and installation. This growth however, led to an \\noversupply of panels starting in 2011. Balancing out supply with demand for solar panels has and \\nresulted in factories to close, and will also result in a continued decrease in manufacturing (Forbes, 2012). \\nThere is significant uncertainty in whether production levels will remain relatively constant in the future \\nor resume the rapid annual increases which the industry experienced prior to 2011. \\nThe projections presented in this chapter assume that production levels will be sufficient to achieve \\nthe cumulative installed capacities from the \\u201cNew Policy\\u201d Scenario of World Energy Outlook 2012, \\nwithout accounting for installed capacity replacement. These assumptions result in annual production in \\n2030 decreased to 22.6 GW compared to 24.6 GW in 2010. While there is a growth in demand for solar \\nenergy, reflected in forecasted growth in total global installed solar capacity from about 38 gigawatts \\n(GW) in 2010 to 491 GW in 2030 (IEA, 2012), this is expected to be met through already existing \\nuninstalled stock of solar panels and future annual production.

By \\n2030, emissions from manufacturing PV cells are expected to decrease to 1.87 MtCO2e. This decrease can \\nbe attributed to the decrease in the annual PV production for 2030 compared to 2010. The annual \\nproduction in 2030 is expected to decrease to 22.6 GW compared to 24.6 GW in 2010. \\nIn December of 2012 EPA published the Global Anthropogenic Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: \\n1990\\u20132030. The baseline emission estimates presented in this analysis have been revised, and the revised \\nestimates are used for the MAC analysis presented in this report. Like the previous estimates, since little \\nliterature is available describing the mitigation activities in the PV cell manufacturing sector, and unlike \\nthe semiconductor and FPD manufacturing sectors, the PV manufacturing sector has not set a voluntary \\nreduction goal, the revised estimates do not include assumptions about the use of mitigation technologies \\nfor crystalline silicon type manufacturing. However, unlike the previous estimates, the baseline now \\nassumes that half of the production process for amorphous silicon (a-Si) use abatement based on new \\nliterature published (Fthenakis et al., 2010). The baseline also assumes that half of the production process \\nfor crystalline silicon (c-Si) technology uses and emits CF4 and C2F6 during manufacturing, as not all PV \\nprocesses use F-GHGs. \\nThe projected revised emissions are estimated based on annual PV production, differentiated by type \\nof technology, country, and the emission factors for respective types. However, now the future annual PV \\nproduction is estimated from the projected cumulative installed capacity obtained from World Energy \\nOutlook, New Policy Scenario (IEA, 2012) as opposed to assumed growth rates. The total annual PV \\nproduction is then differentiated into various types by dividing the total according technology \\nproportions: 77% crystalline Silicon (c-Si), 12% amorphous Silicon (a-Si) and the rest Cadmium Telluride, \\nCopper Indium Gallium Selenide and other categories, which are from the DisplaySearch database \\n(DisplaySearch, 2009). Similarly, the capacity is apportioned by country based on the DisplaySearch \\ndatabase (DisplaySearch, 2009). Like the previous baseline methodology, PV production capacity for each \\ncountry for historic years was extracted from DisplaySearch database (DisplaySearch, 2009). The area of \\ncell produced is estimated based on the cell efficiency, using new data obtained from IEA Solar \\nPhotovoltaic Roadmap (IEA, 2010), and an assumed solar constant of 1000 W/m2. \\nThe NF3 emission factor for a-Si has been updated in the revised baseline estimation methodology. \\nFor the a-Si technology, it was assumed that all facilities use NF3 and out of those, 50% of the facilities \\nhave abatement devices installed. The emission factor for abated facilities was derived from data \\npresented in literature looking at lifecycle NF3 emissions of PV cells (Fthenakis et al., 2010). The emission \\nfactor for unabated facilities was developed using sensitive process information. Lastly, the revised \\nbaseline assumes that only 50% of c-Si technology is assumed to use and emit F-GHGs during \\nmanufacturing and none of the other technologies are assumed to use and emit F-GHGs. \\nIV.12.3 \\nAbatement Measures and Engineering Cost Analysis \\nFour mitigation technology options were identified for the PV manufacturing sector: thermal \\nabatement, catalytic abatement, plasma abatement, and NF3 remote chamber clean. \\n\\u2022  \\nThermal abatement: These point-of-use abatement systems, that use heat to destroy or remove F-\\nGHGs from effluent process streams, are connected directly to a manufacturing tool. \\n\\u2022  \\nCatalytic abatement: Tool effluent process streams are run through abatement systems with \\ncatalysts (e.g., CuO, ZnO, Al2O3) that destroy or remove F-GHGs. \\n\\u2022  \\nPlasma abatement: Plasma in a point-of-use abatement system is used to react (destroy or \\nremove) F-GHGs from the process effluent stream. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-181 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\u2013\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPHOTOVOLTAIC CELL MANUFACTURING \\nTable 12-1: Projected Baseline Emissions from PV Cell Manufacturing: 2010\\u20132030 (MtCO2e) \\nCountry \\n2010 \\n2015 \\n2020 \\n2025 \\n2030 \\nCAGRa  \\n(2010 2030) \\nTop 5 Emitting Countries \\nChina \\n1.0 \\n1.2 \\n1.2 \\n1.1 \\n1.2 \\n0.8% \\nJapan \\n0.3 \\n0.3 \\n0.2 \\n0.2 \\n0.2 \\n\\u22121.5%  \\nUnited States \\n0.2 \\n0.2 \\n0.2 \\n0.2 \\n0.2 \\n0.1% \\nGermany \\n0.3 \\n0.3 \\n0.2 \\n0.1 \\n0.1 \\n\\u22125.6% \\nMalaysia \\n0.2 \\n0.1 \\n0.1 \\n0.1 \\n0.1 \\n\\u22125.0%  \\nRest of Region \\nAfrica \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\nCentral and  South America  \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\nMiddle East \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n\\u22125.0%  \\nEurope \\n0.1 \\n0.1 \\n0.1 \\n0.1 \\n0.1 \\n\\u22125.0%  \\nEurasia \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n\\u22125.0%  \\nAsia \\n0.2 \\n0.2 \\n0.1 \\n0.1 \\n0.1 \\n\\u22125.0%  \\nNorth America \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\n\\u2014 \\nWorld Total \\n2.3 \\n2.4 \\n2.1 \\n1.9 \\n1.9 \\n\\u22121.0%  \\na CAGR= Compound Annual Growth Rate \\nSource:  Updated from projections presented in USEPA, 2012  \\n\\u2022   \\nNF3 remote chamber clean: Highly ionized NF3 is used to clean chemical vapor deposition \\nchambers.

In addition, these systems require large amounts of cooling water, and the use of the \\nsystems result in regulated NOx emissions. \\nThe total facility capital cost for installing thermal abatement systems is estimated to be $5.7 million. \\nThis estimate includes costs for the systems, the necessary ducting, water recirculation and hook up, and \\nnatural gas costs (Fthenakis, 2001; Burton, 2003). The annual operating cost is estimated to be $328,860 at \\nthe facility level. No annual cost savings are associated with using this technology \\nIV.12.3.2 \\nCatalytic Abatement \\nA catalytic abatement system uses a catalyst to destroy or remove F-GHG emissions from the \\neffluents of both plasma etching and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) chamber-cleaning processes. This \\ntype of abatement is applicable at most facilities, but again there may be some space constraints as \\nmentioned for thermal abatement systems. Additionally, because these systems are based on destruction \\nvia catalyst, they must be process/stream specific to achieve the 99% emission reductions quoted in the \\nliterature and used in this analysis (Fthenakis, 2001; Burton, 2003). \\nBecause catalytic destruction systems operate at relatively low temperatures, their use results in little \\nor no NOx emissions, and the required amounts of water are low as well. Because of the high cost of \\ncatalyst replacement, these systems are the least widely used type of abatement (expert judgment). \\nThe capital cost associated with the purchase and installation of the abatement systems is estimated \\nto be $6.9 million per fab (i.e., facility). To use catalytic abatement systems, facilities must factor in the \\nannual cost of resources such as water, waste chemicals, electricity, and catalyst replacements. To cover \\nthese operating expenses, a facility manufacturing PV cells is estimated to incur an annual cost of \\n$455,280. As with other abatement technologies considered in this sector, the use of catalytic abatement \\nsystems will not result in annual cost savings. \\nIV.12.3.3 \\nPlasma Abatement \\nThese systems are applicable to etch processes in most facilities, with some physical space limitations. \\n(These systems though are relatively smaller in size compared with thermal and catalytic systems.) \\nPlasma abatement systems use a small plasma source that effectively dissociates the F-GHG molecules \\nthat react with fragments of the additive gas (hydrogen (H2), oxygen (O2), water (H2O), or methane \\n(CH4)) to produce low molecular weight by-products such as hydrogen fluoride (HF) with little or no \\nGWP. After disassociation, wet scrubbers can remove the molecules. The presence of additive gas is \\nnecessary to prevent later downstream reformation of PFC molecules (Burton, 2003). \\nThe capital cost for plasma abatement systems is estimated to be $1.8 million per facility (Burton, \\n2003), which covers the purchase and installation of plasma systems. Plasma abatement systems require \\nan annual operation cost of $1,190 per chamber, which includes general maintenance and use of the \\nsystems. Total annual facility costs are $51,850 based on an assumed four chambers per tool and 25 tools \\nper facility. The use of plasma abatement systems will not result in annual cost savings. \\nIV.12.3.4 \\nNF3 Remote Chamber Clean \\nNF3 remote chamber clean is an alternative cleaning technology that has the benefit of having a \\nparticularly high (~98%) utilization rate of NF3 (IPCC, 2006), resulting in relatively low emissions \\ncompared with traditional chamber cleans. (The stated utilization is based on utilizations for \\nsemiconductor manufacturing; as a result of large gas flows in PV manufacturing, the actual utilization \\nmay be lower.) NF3 remote clean systems dissociate NF3 using argon gas and converting the source gas to \\nactive F-atoms in the plasma upstream of the process chamber. These electrically neutral atoms can \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-183 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPHOTOVOLTAIC CELL MANUFACTURING \\nselectively remove material in the chamber. The by-products of remote clean include HF, fluorine (F2), \\nand other gases, most of which are removed by facility acid scrubber systems. \\nIt is assumed that PV facilities are not \\u201cNF3 ready\\u201d; in other words, these facilities do not have the \\ncurrent infrastructure to handle the direct installation of NF3 remote systems because this is a relatively \\nnew technology. Therefore, facilities incur capital costs, in addition to system costs, associated with items \\nsuch as gas hook ups and necessary hardware such as manifolds and values. The facility cost is estimated \\nto be $9.2 million. The annual facility cost for NF3 remote clean is estimated to be $3.4 million (Burton, \\n2003). These costs are associated with the purchase of larger volumes of gas (NF3 versus traditional \\nchamber clean gases), general maintenance, and F2 scrubs to remove the highly explosive gas from the \\neffluent. No annual cost savings are associated with using this technology. \\nIV.12.3.5 \\nSummary of Mitigation Technology Costs and Characteristics \\nTable 12-3 summarizes the information used to estimate the break-even prices in the MAC analysis. \\nTable 12-3: Engineering Cost Data on a Facility Basis \\nAbatement Option  \\nProject  \\nLifetime  \\n(Years)  \\nCapital Costs  \\n(2010 USD)  \\nAnnual Revenue   \\n(2010 USD)  \\nAnnual O&M  \\nCosts  \\n(2010 USD)  \\nAbatement  \\nAmount   \\n(tCO2e)  \\nThermal abatement \\n7 \\n$5,701,971  \\n$0 \\n$328,862  \\n13,625   \\nCatalytic abatement \\n7 \\n$6,906,594  \\n$0  \\n$455,277  \\n14,199  \\nPlasma abatement \\n7 \\n$1,814,664  \\n$0  \\n$51,848  \\n1,398 \\nNF3  remote clean  \\n25 \\n$9,200,867  \\n$0 \\n$3,374,861  \\n14,427  \\nIV.12.4 \\nMarginal Abatement Costs Analysis \\nThis section discusses the modeling approach and documents some additional assumptions used in \\nthe MAC analysis for the PV manufacturing sector. \\nIV.12.4.1 \\nMethodological Approach \\nThe MAC analysis applies the abatement measure costs discussed in the previous section of this \\nchapter at two hypothetical facilities to calculate a break-even price for each abatement measure.

This section also provides an \\nexample of how the break-even prices were calculated for each option. \\nIV.12.4.2 \\nDefinition of Model Facility \\nThe manufacture of PV uses F-GHGs depending on the particular substrate and process used in the \\nproduction. Substrates used in the industry include crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, and other thin \\nfilms. F-GHGs are used during the manufacture of crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV cells, amorphous silicon (a-\\nSi), and tandem a-Si/nanocrystaline (nc) silicon PV cells. Other thin film PV technologies do not require \\nthe use of F-GHGs. As with the other electronics manufacturing sectors, emissions in this sector result \\nfrom two main types of manufacturing processes: etching substrates and cleaning CVD chambers. \\nManufacturing processes and uses of GHGs across the industry are generally similar; therefore, only one \\ntype of model facility was considered for this analysis. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-184 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n  \\nPHOTOVOLTAIC CELL MANUFACTURING \\n\\u2022   \\nModel: The model facility is a facility that represents a PV manufacturing facility of average \\nmanufacturing capacity (DisplaySearch, 2009) of 80 MW with an estimated 25 tools with 3.5 \\nchambers.

Estimating this parameter required making a \\nnumber of assumptions regarding the distribution of emissions by manufacturing process (etch and \\nclean), in addition to process-specific estimates of technical applicability and market penetration. These \\nassumptions are held constant for all model years.

There is no comprehensive published information \\non the extent abatement systems are really in use in the industry. Assumed abatement system reduction \\nefficiencies are really only achievable if the systems are properly operated and maintained, which may \\nnot always be the case (USEPA, 2008a and 2008b). Also, abatement system reduction efficiencies may \\nvary by gas (e.g., CF4 is harder to abate than other F-GHGs because of its thermo-stability). Additionally, \\nthere are not known voluntary reduction initiatives for the PV sector. Because of this the model facility is \\nuncontrolled, information about the use of abatement in baseline emissions is highly uncertain. \\nOther reasons for uncertainties inherent to the baseline emission estimates include assumptions about \\nthe portion of the PV manufacturing industry that uses F-GHGs, and the unpredictability in the growth \\nof the solar PV production capacity. The activity data used, the cumulative solar PV capacity, is modeled \\nwith its own set of assumptions from the IEA and is framed by the fast-growing renewable energy sector. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-187 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPHOTOVOLTAIC CELL MANUFACTURING \\nAs this is the foundation of future baseline emission estimates, it gives rise to uncertainties. Furthermore, \\nmarket dynamics will also contribute to the fluctuations with respect to facilities\\u2019 utilization rates as well \\nas fractions of PV cells started and inventoried, all of which are assumed constant for purposes of \\ndeveloping baseline emissions. Another limitation is that the baseline emission estimates do not take into \\naccount the retiring of PV cells. It is assumes that any new manufacturing is done to meet the increase in \\ninstalled capacity and not to replace any replacement of capacity The emission estimates are hence \\nconservative as inclusion of this assumption would lead to slightly higher emissions for each year. The \\nuse of Tier 1 emission factors to estimate emissions also gives rise uncertainty as it is the \\u201cleast accurate \\nestimation method\\u201d (IPCC, 2006). The Tier 1 method gives an aggregate emission estimate for all of the F\\u00ad\\nGHG using processes simultaneously, which introduces a higher level of uncertainty as the utilization \\nrates of gases differ between etch and chamber cleaning processes. \\nLastly, due to the similarities between this sector and the semiconductor manufacturing sector, the \\nmitigation technologies considered for PV were those used in the semiconductor sector. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-188 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPHOTOVOLTAIC CELL MANUFACTURING \\nReferences  \\nApplied Materials. 1999. \\u201cCatalytic Abatement of PFC Emissions.\\u201d Presented at Semicon Southwest 99: \\nPartnership for PFC Emissions Reductions, Austin, TX, October 18, 1999. \\nBeu, L. 2005. \\u201cReduction of Perfluorocarbon (PFC) Emissions: 2005 State-of-the-Technology Report.\\u201d \\nTT#0510469A-ENG.

The \\ngrowth in emissions is primarily driven by projected growth in manufacturing capacity in China. The \\nbaseline projections presented here are updated relative to those presented in Global Anthropogenic Non\\u00ad\\nCO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 1990 to 2030 (USEPA, 2012). The updated projections include lower \\nexpected production levels of Liquid Crystal Displays and increased mitigation, resulting in significantly \\nlower projected emissions. Emissions projections for this sector are particularly uncertain due to limited \\ninformation on emissions rates and reduction efficiencies, variable industry production growth rates, and \\nrapidly evolving FPD technologies. \\nFigure 13-1: F-GHG Emissions from FPD Manufacturing: 2000\\u20132030 (MtCO2e) \\nSource: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), 2012 \\n1 The term flat panel display encompasses many technologies, such as liquid crystal displays, low temperature \\npolysilicon (LTPS) or transparent amorphous oxide semiconductor (TAOS), and active matrix light emitting diodes \\n(AMOLED).

The emissions reductions equate to 80% of the projected baseline emissions in \\neach year. While all abatement options identified for this sector reduce emissions significantly, none has \\nthe ability to reduce or replace 100% of emissions from FPD manufacturing. Figure 13-2 presents the \\nglobal MAC curves for 2010, 2020, and 2030 for the FPD manufacturing sector. \\nFigure 13-2: Global Abatement Potential in FPD Manufacturing: 2010, 2020, and 2030 \\nThe following sections of this chapter first describe the activities and sources of F-GHG emissions in \\nthe FPD manufacturing sector and present the projected emissions for 2010 to 2030.

Figure 13-3 shows the breakdown of etch and clean \\nemissions for the typical facility. \\nFigure 13-3: Global F-GHG Emissions in 2020 by Facility Type (% of GWP-Weighted Emissions) \\nIV.13.2.1  \\nActivity Data or Important Sectoral or Regional Trends and Related\\nAssumptions \\nFPD facility-level emissions were modeled using estimated gas consumption data based on World \\nLCD Industry Cooperation Committee (WLICC) reported data and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \\nChange (IPCC) Tier 2b emission factors. Because the WLICC does not fully represent all world \\nmanufacturing capacity, global emissions were estimated using estimated global capacity, in terms of \\narea of substrate produced, from the DisplaySearch Equipment Database and IPCC Tier 1 emission \\nfactors for FPD manufacturing as opposed to using WLICC gas consumption information. \\nGlobal emission estimates take into account the WLICC goal, which was agreed to by all three \\nmember associations. The goal is to meet and maintain an aggregate 2010 F-GHG emission target of 10% \\nof projected business-as-usual 2010 emissions, or 3.01 MtCO2e (expressed in the goal as 0.82 million tons \\nof carbon equivalent). (This emission reduction goal was met in 2010; hence, mitigation technologies and \\nstrategies were assumed to have penetrated the market to a certain extent already in WLICC Partner \\ncountries Japan, Taiwan, and Korea.) The WLICC member associations are estimated to have 96% of the \\nworld\\u2019s FPD manufacturing capacity in 2010. It is assumed, therefore, that there has already been some \\nlevel of mitigation technology penetration to meet the stated goal in this sector in the baseline projections. \\nCurrent market trends indicate major growth for capacity in this sector shifting to China, and without a \\nreduction goal or mitigation measures, FPD emissions in China will drastically increase. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-193 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFLAT PANEL DISPLAY \\nIV.13.2.2 \\nEmissions Estimates and Related Assumptions \\nThe large majority of FPD manufacturing is in Asia, and production capacity continues to grow in \\nthat region.

This process is highly efficient (using ~98% of the gas in a process) resulting in lower \\nemissions on a mass and CO2 basis than traditional in-situ chamber clean processes which uses \\napproximately 20% to 50% of the gas in a process (IPCC, 2006). \\n\\u2022 \\nGas replacement: Higher GWP gases are replaced with lower GWP gases.  \\nTable 13-2  presents the reduction efficiency and the applicability  of each mitigation technology  to  \\nemissions from a type of process (etch and/or clean).

A CAS \\nis a large-scale thermal oxidation abatement system that is located on the roof of FPD facilities, so there \\nare little expected space limitations for this technology. This technology has recently started to come \\nonline and is only applicable to etch emissions. Two CDM projects (one from LG and one from Samsung) \\nin Korea have used this technology (CDM Project #3440 and CDM project #3333). Its use is, however, \\nlimited throughout the rest of the industry because it is expensive and relatively new. \\nThe capital cost for a CAS is $4.5 million. The annual operation and maintenance (O&M) cost, which \\ninclude items such as utilities and parts, is estimated to be $2.5 million for a facility. No revenues are \\ngenerated from using a CAS. \\nIV.13.3.2 \\nThermal Abatement \\nThermal abatement systems can be used to abate emissions from both etching and CVD chamber-\\ncleaning processes. The use of thermal abatement offers the benefit of not affecting the manufacturing \\nprocess (Applied Materials, 1999); however, the systems do require space that may not be available in \\nsome facilities. In addition, these systems require large amounts of cooling water, and the use of the \\nsystems results in regulated NOx emissions. \\nThe total facility capital cost for installing thermal abatement systems is estimated to be $5.7 million. \\nThis estimate includes costs for the systems, the necessary ducting, water recirculation and hook up, and \\nnatural gas costs (Fthenakis, 2001; Burton, 2003). The annual operating cost is estimated to be $328,860 at \\nthe facility level. No annual savings are associated with using this technology. \\nIV.13.3.3 \\nCatalytic Abatement \\nA catalytic abatement system is used to abate emissions from both etching and CVD chamber-\\ncleaning processes. This type of abatement is applicable at most facilities, but again there may be some \\nspace constraints, as also discussed for thermal abatement systems, limiting the use of these systems in \\nthe market. Another limitation to their use is high catalyst replacement costs. \\nThe capital cost associated with purchasing and installing the abatement systems is estimated to be \\n$6.9 million per facility. To use catalytic abatement systems, facilities must factor in the annual cost of \\nresources such as water, waste chemicals, electricity, and catalyst replacements. To cover these operating \\nexpenses, a facility manufacturing FPDs is estimated to incur an annual cost of $455,280.

(These systems, however, are relatively smaller in size compared with \\nthermal and catalytic systems.) Plasma abatement systems use a small plasma source that effectively \\ndissociates the F-GHG molecules that react with fragments of the additive gas (hydrogen (H2), oxygen \\n(O2) water (H2O), or methane (CH4)) to produce low molecular weight by-products such as hydrogen \\n, \\nfluoride (HF) with little or no global warming potential (GWP). After disassociation, wet scrubbers can \\nremove the molecules. The presence of additive gas is necessary to prevent later downstream reformation \\nof F-GHG molecules (Motorola, 1998). \\nThe capital cost for plasma abatement systems is estimated to be $1.8 million per facility (Fthenakis, \\n2001; Burton, 2003), which covers the purchase and installation of plasma systems. Plasma abatement \\nsystems require an annual operation cost of $1,190 per chamber, which includes general maintenance and \\nuse of the systems. The total annual facility cost is $51,850 based on an assumed number of tools per \\nfacility and chambers per tool. The use of plasma abatement systems will not result in annual cost \\nsavings. \\nIV.13.3.5 \\nNF3 Remote Chamber Clean \\nNF3 remote chamber clean is an alternative cleaning technology that has the benefit of having a \\nparticularly high utilization rate of NF3 (~98%; IPCC, 2006), resulting in relatively low emissions \\ncompared with traditional chamber cleans. (Note: The stated utilization is based on utilizations for \\nsemiconductor manufacturing; as a result of large gas flows in FPD manufacturing the actual utilization \\nmay be lower.) NF3 remote clean systems dissociate NF3 using argon gas, converting the source gas to \\nactive F-atoms in the plasma, upstream of the process chamber. These electrically neutral atoms can \\nselectively remove material in the chamber. The by-products of remote clean include HF, fluorine (F2), \\nand other gases, most of which are removed by facility acid scrubber systems. The use of NF3 remote \\nclean systems is much more prevalent in new facilities because the technology was not available when \\nmany old facilities were constructed. \\nIt is assumed that FPD facilities are not \\u201cNF3 ready\\u201d; in other words, these facilities do not have the \\ncurrent infrastructure to handle the direct installation of NF3 remote systems because this is a relatively \\nnew technology. Therefore, facilities incur capital costs, in addition to system costs, associated with items \\nsuch as gas hook ups and necessary hardware such as manifolds and values. The facility cost is estimated \\nto be $9.2 million. The annual facility cost for NF3 remote clean is estimated to be $3.3 million (Burton, \\n2003). This cost is associated with the purchase of larger volumes of gas (NF3 versus traditional chamber \\nclean gases), general maintenance, and F2 scrubs to remove the highly explosive gas from the effluent. No \\nannual cost savings are associated with using this technology. \\nIV.13.3.6 \\nGas Replacement \\nGas replacement can be used to mitigate emissions from the traditional CVD chamber-cleaning \\nprocess. Gas replacement can be applied in most facilities and has already been used throughout the \\nindustry in many instances. For this strategy, a lower GWP gas replaces a higher GWP gas. The most \\ncommon replacement is using NF3 to replace SF6. \\nFacilities replacing SF6 with NF3 incur an estimated capital cost of $1.2 million for items such as gas \\nhook ups and implementation. Annual savings for this option result from the lower cost of the \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nIV-196 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCentral abatement  \\n15 \\n$4,487,400  \\n$0  \\n$2,547,000  \\n13,889  \\nThermal abatement  \\n7  \\n$5,701,971  \\n$0  \\n$328,862  \\n62,587  \\nCatalytic abatement  \\n7  \\n$6,906,594  \\n$0  \\n$455,277  \\n65,222  \\nPlasma abatement  \\n7 \\n$1,814,664 \\n$0 \\n$51,847  \\n14,941 \\nNF3  remote clean  \\n21 \\n$9,200,867  \\n$0 \\n$3,374,861  \\n56,496 \\nGas replacement \\n21 \\n$1,180,000 \\n$34,400 \\n$0 \\n22,797 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFLAT PANEL DISPLAY \\nreplacement gas and were estimated to be $34,400, based on the incremental cost of the gases and the \\naverage amount of gas consumed per facility.

The facility emission breakdown is essential to this analysis, \\nbecause some mitigation technologies are applicable to either both or just one type of manufacturing \\nprocess (see Table 13-2 above). \\nIV.13.4.3 \\nEstimating the Technical Effectiveness Parameter \\nSimilar to the methods employed for analyzing abatement in the semiconductor and photovoltaics \\nmanufacturing sectors, this analysis developed a technical effectiveness parameter, defined as the \\npercentage reductions achievable by each technology/process combination. Estimating this parameter \\nrequires assumptions regarding the distribution of emissions by manufacturing process (etch and clean), \\nin addition to process-specific assumptions on technical applicability and market penetration.

DAYCENT utilizes the soil C \\nmodeling framework developed in the Century model (Parton et al. 1987, 1988, 1994; Metherell et al. \\n1993), with refinement to simulate C dynamics at a daily time-step. Key processes simulated by \\nDAYCENT include crop production, organic matter formation and decomposition, soil water and \\ntemperature regimes by layer, in addition to nitrification and denitrification processes. DAYCENT has \\nbeen evaluated in several studies (e.g., Del Grosso et al. 2002, 2005, 2009) and has also been recently \\nadopted by EPA to develop the soil C and soil estimates for the annual Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas \\nEmissions and Sinks (EPA, 2013) submitted to the UNFCCC. \\nCrop yields, direct N2O and CH4 emissions, and soil organic C stock changes were simulated by \\nDAYCENT at a 0.5\\u00b0grid resolution. Indirect N2O emissions6 were estimated simulated amounts of nitrate \\nleaching, N runoff in overland water flow, and NOx emissions from a site according to the DAYCENT \\nmodel7 combined with the IPCC default factors for indirect N2O emissions (De Klein et al., 2006). In order \\nto represent the longer term effect of cultivation on soil C, simulations started in 1700 after a simulation of \\n3000 years of native vegetation, which is a similar procedure to the methods applied in the US \\nGreenhouse Gas Inventory for agricultural soil C and N2O (USEPA, 2013). \\nFor this study, a number of data sources were used to establish the business-as-usual baseline \\nconditions and simulate alternative management options for the global non-rice croplands. Weather data \\nwere based on a dataset generated by the North American Carbon Program at a 0.5\\u00b0resolution with daily \\nminimum and maximum temperatures and daily precipitation.8 The soils data were based on the FAO \\nDigitized Soil Map of the World (FAO 1996). Major cropland areas of the world were simulated according \\nto a global cropland map developed by Ramankutty et al. (2008), with grid cells with less than 5% \\ncropland area excluded in the analysis. \\nNative vegetation data are described in Cramer and Field (1999) and Melillo et al. (1993). Natural \\nvegetation was converted to cropland in the DAYCENT simulations at an approximate first year of \\ncultivation, based on historical records compiled by Ramankutty and Foley (1998) and Ramankutty et al., \\n(2008). \\nDue to lack of global data availability, low input crop production with intensive tillage practices were \\nassumed prior to 1950, consistent with typical practices in that time period. From 1950 to 2010, \\nmanagement was based on data including tillage and residue management, weeding practices, mineral N \\nfertilization, manure N amendments to soils, and irrigation. Crop planting and harvest dates were based \\non Sacks et al. (2008). Crops were assumed to grow in monoculture due to insufficient data for \\ndetermining typical crop rotation practices from the global datasets. Maize and sorghum were double-\\ncropped in some regions based on Sacks et al. (2008). Model performance was evaluated by comparing \\nsimulated crop yields to observed crop yields (Monfreda et al. 2008), and minor adjustments were made \\nto parameters in order to be reasonably consistent with the observed yields.

Crop yields and GHG fluxes were simulated at the \\n0.5\\u00b0resolution for periods 2000-2010 and 2011-2030 with five-year increments. A baseline scenario is \\nestablished for each crop production system assuming business-as-usual management practices described \\nabove. Seven mitigation scenarios were then analyzed (see Section 3.4 below). \\nEmissions estimated by the DAYCENT model for major crop types (maize, wheat, barley, sorghum, \\nsoybean and millet) were based on emissions per unit (m2) of physical area in each in each 0.5\\u00b0 x 0.5\\u00b0 grid \\ncell, and so were multiplied by an estimate of cropland area in each grid cell to compute total GHG \\nemissions. We approximated crop-specific areas using harvested area data. First, crop-specific harvested \\nareas for each 0.5\\u00b0 x 0.5\\u00b0 grid cell were estimated from Monfreda et al. (2008). For each grid cell where we \\nsimulated double-cropping for maize or sorghum, we reduced maize or sorghum harvested area by 50%. \\nNext, harvested areas for analogous crops were added to areas of the major crop types (i.e., oats with \\nwheat, rye with barley, green corn with maize, and lentil, green bean, string bean, broad bean, cow pea, \\nchickpea and dry bean with soybeans) to increase the coverage of cropland area. The sums of harvested \\nareas fractions computed in this manner were less than total cropland areas (Ramankutty et al. 2008) for \\nall but 1.6% of grid cells. In the last step, total harvested area was scaled to match at the country scale \\ndata on harvested areas reported in FAOSTAT. By including analogous crops and matching FAOSTAT \\nharvested areas, the cropland area simulated by DAYCENT was about 61% of the global non-rice \\ncropland areas reported by FAOSTAT. \\nProjected baseline emissions and crop production were then established for both irrigated and \\nrainfed production systems using simulated yields and GHG emissions rates from DAYCENT model and \\nadjusting with projected growth rates of these production systems by IFPRI\\u2019s International Model for \\nPolicy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) model. In DAYCENT, crop \\nproduction areas were held constant at the 2010 level to obtain the biophysical effects of management \\npractice changes on crop yields and GHG fluxes. Projected acreage changes from IMPACT model reflect \\nsocio-economic drivers such as population growth and technological changes to meet global food \\ndemand (Nelson et al., 2010). \\nV.1.3 \\nAbatement Measures and Engineering Cost Analysis \\nV.1.3.1 \\nMitigation Technologies \\nThe mitigation options evaluated in this analysis were based on review of the literature to identify \\nthe most promising options, while also taking data availability and potential for modeling within \\nDAYCENT into consideration. The mitigation options represent alternative management practices that \\nwould alter crop yields and the associated GHG emissions, including adoption of no-till management, \\nsplit N fertilization applications, application of nitrification inhibitors, increased N fertilization (20% \\nincrease over business-as-usual), decreased N fertilization (20% reduction from business-as-usual), and \\n100% crop residue incorporation. \\nThe N management practices (split N fertilization, nitrification inhibitors, increased and decreased N \\nfertilization) influence N2O emissions in addition to soil organic C stocks due to reduced or enhanced C \\ninputs associated with the level of crop production. Smith et al. (2007) estimated that 89% of the overall \\ntechnical potential for mitigation of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions is associated with carbon \\nsequestration in soils. Although soil organic C stock fluxes are negligible in the baseline, there is \\nconsiderable opportunity to modify stocks in the future. Levels of soil organic matter and in particular \\nsoil carbon both influence, and are influenced by cropland productivity. Other things being equal, higher \\ncrop yields may increase soil C wherever more crop residue can be incorporated into the soil.

Practices such as adoption of conservation tillage, restoration of degraded lands, improved water \\nand nutrient management, and cropping intensification can increase soil carbon by enhancing C inputs to \\nsoils from greater crop production or decrease the losses of C from soils with lower decomposition rates \\n(Paustian et al. 1997; Six et al., 2000). \\nNo-Till Adoption \\nAll cultivation and field preparation events were removed except for seeding, which occurred \\ndirectly into the residue. \\n\\u2022  \\nApplicability: This option is available in all regions and all time periods \\n\\u2022  \\nEconomic Applicability and Cost: There are reductions in labor costs associated with the \\nreduction in field preparation that are based on data from U.S. Department of Agriculture \\n(USDA) Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data, which provides labor \\nestimates for conventional and conservation tillage on both irrigated and rain-fed land by major \\ncrop. Conversion to no-till would require purchasing equipment for direct planting. However, if \\nthis equipment is purchased in place of equipment used for traditional tillage, there may be little \\nincremental capital cost associated with no-till. Some crop budgets actually indicate lower capital \\ncosts for no-till because of the need for fewer passes over the field, which lead to reduced \\nequipment depreciation.

\\nV.1.4 Marginal Abatement Costs Analysis \\nThe MAC analysis assimilates the abatement measures\\u2019 technology costs, expected benefits, and \\nemission reductions presented in Section X.3 to compute the cost of abatement for each measure. Similar \\nto the approach used in other non-CO2 sectors of this report, we compute a break-even price for each \\nabatement option for 195 countries to construct MAC curves illustrating the technical, net GHG \\nmitigation potential at specific break-even prices for 2010, 2020, and 2030. \\nThis section describes the general modeling approach applied in this sector, which serve as additional \\ninputs to the MAC analysis that adjust the abatement project costs, benefits, and the technical abatement \\npotential in each country. \\nV.1.4.1 \\nEstimate Abatement Measure Costs and Benefits \\nAs a general framework of the MAC analysis, the break-even price for each mitigation option is \\ncalculated by setting total benefits (i.e., higher yields ) equal to total costs of a given mitigation option. \\nThis framework, also referred to as the International Marginal Abatement Cost (IMAC) model, is \\ndocumented in USEPA (2006) and Beach et al. (2008). \\nV.1.4.2 \\nMAC Analysis Results \\nGlobal abatement potential in the Non-Rice Croplands sector equates to approximately 6 to 13% of its \\ntotal annual emissions between 2010 and 2030 at a relatively low carbon price of $5 per ton of CO2 \\nequivalent ($/tCO2e). Table 1-3 presents mitigation potential at selected break-even prices for 2030. GHG \\nmitigation and its cost-effectiveness vary significantly by country or region.

No-till dominates the mitigation potentials in the \\nearly years, owing to its large effect on soil C. However, this dominance disappears over time as soils \\nbecome \\u201csaturated\\u201d with C. By 2030, the mitigation potential (limited to N2O) of reduced fertilization \\nnearly equals that of no-till. Over an even longer time scales, only the N2O flux remains as soils reach a \\nnew equilibrium level of Soil C. \\nV.1.5 Sensitivity Analysis \\nWe tested the sensitivity of the results by adding an additional \\u201cOptimal N Fertilization\\u201d option, \\nwhich has substantial effects on global yields and emissions. \\nOptimal N fertilization \\nThis option allows the model to maximize soil carbon through optimization of fertilizer inputs, \\ngiving a \\u201cbest case\\u201d result of the application of existing technology and crop patterns. Of course, baseline \\nlevels vary widely from this optimum with some regions over-applying N and many under-applying N \\nrelative to crop needs. This case shows what could be achieved if nutrient stress is removed at each time \\nstep. \\n\\u2022  \\nApplicability: This option is available in all regions and all time periods \\n\\u2022  \\nEconomic Applicability and Cost: Due to the large number of ways this option might be put in \\npractice, costs are limited to the change in N used. \\n\\u2022  \\nAdditional factors: In cases where yields increase as a result, production is valued at the market \\nprice. No tax or other benefits are included in this option. \\nThis analysis resulted in the global MAC curve shown in Figure 1-5, and summarized in Table 1-5. \\nWith Optimal N Fertilization included in the analysis, global mitigation increases from a maximum of 86 \\nMt to 129 Mt in 2010. Global mitigation in 2030 increases from a maximum of 56 Mt to about 86 Mt. \\nOverall the MAC analysis results suggest that optimal fertilization to achieve maximum crop yields is \\npotentially the single most significant source of GHG mitigation in cropland soil management. This \\noption accounts for approximately 44% of the total global mitigation potential in 2010 and 2030. The \\nsecond most significant mitigation option is no-till practice, accounting for about 39% of the global total \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-13 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n-$30 \\n-$20 \\n-$10 \\n$0 \\n$10 \\n$20 \\n$30 \\n$40 \\n$50 \\n$60 \\n$/tCO2 e \\n0 \\n20 \\n40 \\n60 \\n80 \\n100 \\n120 \\n140 \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\nCROPLANDS \\nmitigation potential.12 Reduction in N fertilizer application and adoption of nitrification inhibitors would \\nalso make substantial contributions to net GHG reductions from cropland soil management. \\nFigure  1-5:  \\nGlobal Abatement Potential  in Non-rice Croplands Management: 2010, 2020, and 2030  \\n(Includes \\u201cOptimal N Fertilization\\u201d Strategy)  \\nTable 1-5: Global Total Abatement Potential from Cropland Soils by Measure (MtCO2e) (Includes \\u201cOptimal N \\nFertilization\\u201d Strategy) \\nGHG Mitigation by Option (total all prices) \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\nReduced Fertilization \\n11.1 \\n9% \\n0.0 \\n14%  \\n17.7 \\n21% \\nIncreased Fertilization \\n0.2 \\n0% \\n0.0 \\n0% \\n0.0 \\n0% \\n100% Residue Incorporation \\n0.3 \\n0% \\n0.1 \\n0%  \\n0.0 \\n0% \\nNitrification Inhibitors \\n6.0 \\n5% \\n5.6 \\n6% \\n6.1 \\n7% \\nSplit N Fertilization \\n3.6 \\n3% \\n2.7 \\n3% \\n2.2 \\n3% \\nNo-Till Adoption \\n50.8 \\n39%  \\n35.4 \\n35%  \\n20.9 \\n25% \\nOptimal N Fertilization \\n57.3 \\n44% \\n42.2 \\n42% \\n37.7 \\n45% \\nTOTAL \\n129.4 \\n100% \\n86.1 \\n100% \\n84.7 \\n100% \\n12 As discussed above, mitigation potential from adoption of no-till practice is likely over-estimated with 100% \\nconventional tillage assumed in the business-as-usual baseline. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-14 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n-$30 \\n-$20 \\n-$10 \\n$0 \\n$10 \\n$20 \\n$30 \\n$40 \\n$50 \\n$60 \\n$/tCO2e \\n0.0 \\n5.0 \\n10.0 \\n15.0 \\n20.0 \\n25.0 \\n30.0 \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\nChina 2010 \\nIndia 2010 \\nUSA 2010 \\nBrazil 2010 \\nArgentina 2010 \\nChina 2030 \\nUSA 2030 \\nIndia 2030 \\nBrazil 2030 \\nArgentina 2030 \\nCROPLANDS \\nFigure 1-6 shows the effect on the top-5 countries.

The mitigation \\npotential presented in this analysis should be viewed to represent the technical potential of the \\nmitigation options analyzed. \\n\\u2022  \\nAvailability and quality of data to represent the highly complex and heterogeneous crop \\nproduction systems of the world. Compared to the previous EPA marginal abatement cost curve \\nanalysis (USEPA, 2006), there are major improvements in the datasets used to represent the \\nglobal crop production systems and the business-as-usual baseline conditions. However, data in \\nsome areas, such as management practices which have significant influence on the GHG fluxes, \\nare not always available for all countries or regions. Approximations had to be made based on \\nlimited literature or expert judgment. Moreover, collecting and developing regionally specific \\ncost estimates of emerging and/or not widely adopted management practices or mitigation \\nmeasures has been a challenge and in some cases global datasets had to be used. \\n\\u2022  \\nBiophysical modeling uncertainties. The evaluation of simulated crop yields against observed \\nyields suggests that DAYCENT modeling performance varies by crop 14, leading to potential \\nbiases in estimated GHG emissions. Model structure is found to be the largest contributor to \\nuncertainty in simulation results using DAYCENT, typically more than 75% of overall \\nuncertainty in estimates (Ogle et al. 2010, Del Grosso et al. 2010). Further model evaluation will \\nbe carried out to understand potential model bias and prediction error using empirical based \\nprocedure discussed in Ogle et al. (2007). In addition, soil carbon, which has a significant impact \\non the net GHG emissions and mitigation potential from the sector, is particularly challenging to \\nsimulate given the lack of monitoring data at the global scale. Sensitivity tests would be useful to \\nassess how alternative modeling approaches and assumptions may influence modeling results. \\n\\u2022  \\nPotential interactions of multiple mitigation measures are not fully addressed in this analysis. \\nIn this analysis, mitigation options are applied to independent segments of the crop production \\nsystems to avoid double counting. In reality, multiple mitigation options can be applied, and \\ntheir order of adoption and potential interactions may affect the aggregate GHG mitigation. \\nAlternative approach should be investigated to provide more realistic representation of economic \\napplicability of potential mitigation measures. \\n14 Overall, simulated yields for maize agree reasonably well with observed yields; simulated average yields for \\nwheat, barley and sorghum are lower than observed yields; simulated average yields for soybean are above observed \\nyields. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-16 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCROPLANDS \\nReferences  \\nBeach, R.H., DeAngelo, B., Rose, S., Salas, W., Li, C., DelGrosso, S.

There are also changes in soil organic carbon (C) stocks and associated CO2 fluxes. \\nWhen paddy fields are flooded, decomposition of organic material gradually depletes the \\noxygen present in the soil and floodwater, causing anaerobic conditions in the soil. Anaerobic \\ndecomposition of soil organic matter by methanogenic bacteria generates CH4. Some of this CH4 is \\ndissolved in the floodwater, but the remainder is released to the atmosphere, primarily through the rice \\nplants themselves. Minor amounts of CH4 also escape from the soil via diffusion and bubbling through \\nthe floodwaters. In addition, as with other crops, human activities influence soil N2O emissions through \\naddition of synthetic and organic nitrogen fertilizers and other practices and soil C stocks through \\nresidue management as well as any practices that effect crop yields. \\nIn 2010, the net global GHG emissions from rice cultivation were approximately 561 MTCO2e. The \\ntop 5 emitting countries \\u2013 India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and China \\u2013accounted for 77% of the \\nglobal total net emissions. Figure 2-1 displays the baseline net global GHG emissions for the rice sector. \\nNet GHG emissions from rice cultivation are projected to grow by 33% to 750 MTCO2e between 2010 and \\n2030. There is a small amount of growth in emissions occurring in developing regions to meet the \\ndemand for rice products from growing populations and higher incomes, but the biggest contributor to \\nthe increase in net GHG emissions simulated between 2010 and 2030 is a reduction in the soil C sink over \\ntime. In the Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model, there are fairly large increases in soil C in the \\ninitial periods in many countries as they have recently changed practices to incorporate more residues \\ninto the soil.

Global, Tier-I datasets such as EPA\\u2019s Global \\nAnthropogenic Non-CO2 GHG Emissions Report (EPA, 2012) show that agriculture is the biggest source \\nof CH4 emissions, and within agriculture, rice cultivation is the second largest source, behind enteric \\nfermentation.1 Rice cultivation accounted for 7% of global CH4 emissions in 2005 (USEPA, 2012). Rice \\ncultivation is also a significant source of N2O emissions but these are not included in most global datasets. \\n1 Global CH4 emissions from agriculture were estimated at 3,035.4 MtCO2e (2005), about 45% of the global total of \\n6815.8 MtCO2e.

Wetland rice is the largest category, and is responsible for large net CH4 \\nemissions.2 Aerobic decomposition of organic matter gradually depletes the oxygen present in the soil \\nand water, resulting in anaerobic conditions in the rice paddies. Methanogenic bacteria decompose soil \\norganic matter under anaerobic conditions in rice paddies, generating CH4. Significant amounts of CH4 \\nare oxidized by aerobic methanotrophic bacteria into CO2 in the soil. The remaining unoxidized CH4 is \\nreleased to the atmosphere through diffusion and ebullition and through roots and stems of rice plants. \\nThus, unlike the non-paddy rice agricultural soils which are typically CH4 sinks, paddy rice cultivation is \\na major source of CH4 emissions. \\nN2O is another significant component of net GHG emissions from rice cultivation. N2O is produced \\nthrough nitrification and denitrification from microbial activities under the anoxic condition. N2O \\nemissions occur directly from soils, and indirectly through volatilization of compounds such as NH3 and \\nNOx and subsequent deposition as well as through leaching and runoff. Table 2-1 shows that in 2010, \\nwhile CH4 accounted for the largest share of emissions with 484.1 MtCO2e (65% of non-CO2 emissions \\nfrom rice cultivation), N2O contributed substantially, with 260.0 MtCO2e (35%). Both dry and irrigated \\nrice are a source of N2O emissions. \\nSoil carbon stocks are not a non-CO2 GHG but also have important implications for net GHG \\nemissions and are affected by non-CO2 mitigation options so we estimate total emissions net of their \\neffect on soil C stocks in this report. \\nV.2.2.1  \\nActivity Data or Important Sectoral or Regional Trends and Related\\nAssumptions \\nDNDC Modeling of GHG Fluxes and Crop Yields \\nThe Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model was used to simulate production, crop yields and \\ngreenhouse gas fluxes of global paddy rice under \\u201cbusiness-as-usual\\u201d (BAU) condition and various \\nmitigation strategies. DNDC is a soil biogeochemical model that simulates the processes determining the \\ninteractions among ecological drivers, soil environmental factors, and relevant biochemical or \\ngeochemical reactions, which collectively determine the rates of trace gas production and consumption in \\nagricultural ecosystems (Li, 2001). Details of management (e.g., crop rotation, tillage, fertilization, manure \\namendment, irrigation, weeding, and grazing) have been parameterized and linked to the various \\nbiogeochemical processes (e.g., crop growth, litter production, soil water infiltration, decomposition, \\nnitrification, denitrification, fermentation) embedded in DNDC (e.g., Li et al., 2004; Li et al., 2006; Li, 2011; \\nAbdalla et al., 2011; Giltrap et al., 2011; Dai et al., 2012). 3 \\nDNDC predicts daily CH4, N2O and soil carbon fluxes from rice paddies through the growing and \\nfallow seasons as fields remain flooded or move between flooded and drained conditions during the \\nseason. \\n2 Globally, about 2 percent of rice is grown in dry conditions and this production system is a net sink for CH4 (source: \\nDNDC estimates discussed below). \\n3 The paddy-rice version of DNDC has been validated for a number of countries and world regions and is used for \\nnational trace gas inventory studies in North America, Europe, and Asia (e.g., Smith et al., 2002; Follador et al., 2011; \\nLeip et al., 2011; Li et al., 2002; Cai et al., 2003; Li et al., 2005). \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-22 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n0 \\n10,000,000 \\n20,000,000 \\n30,000,000 \\n40,000,000 \\n50,000,000 \\n60,000,000 \\nDeepwater \\nUpland \\nIrrigated - Dry Seeding \\nIrrigated - Midseason Drainage \\nIrrigated - Continuous Flooding \\nRainfed \\nRICE \\nFor this study, a modified version of the DNDC 9.5 Globe database was used to simulate crop yields \\nand GHG fluxes from global paddy rice cultivation systems. The DNDC 9.5 global database contains \\ninformation on soil characteristics, crop planted area, and management conditions (fertilization, \\nirrigation, season, and tillage) on a 0.5 by 0.5 degree grid cell of the world. The database is used to \\nestablish the initial conditions in the model in 2000. The model considers all paddy rice production \\nsystems, including irrigated and rainfed rice, and single, double and mixed rice as well as deepwater and \\nupland cropping systems. For this study, baseline and mitigation scenario modeling is carried out for all \\nrice-producing countries in the world that produce a substantial quantity of rice. \\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) country-level statistics (FAOSTAT 2010) were used to \\nestablish harvested area for rice. The total area was calculated for each country in the Globe database for \\neach type, and evenly distributed across all grid cells within a country in the absence of sub-national \\ninformation. Figure 2-3 shows the distribution of rice across major systems for the five largest producers \\nand an aggregate of the rest of the world. \\nFigure 2-3: \\nDNDC Rice Cropland Area Sown, Top 5 countries, by Type and Water Management \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-23 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTable 2-2: \\nBaseline yields for 2010, 2020 and 2030 for selected countries (kg/ha) \\nRICE \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\nCountry/Region \\nIrrigated \\nRainfed \\nDeepwater \\nUpland \\nIrrigated \\nRainfed \\nDeepwater \\nUpland \\nIrrigated \\nRainfed \\nDeepwater \\nUpland \\nTop 5 Countries by Production \\nChina \\n6,158.2 \\n4,002.9 \\n622.5 \\n2,280.5 \\n6,522.0 \\n4,193.0 \\n702.5 \\n2,560.9 \\n7,161.0 \\n4,583.2 \\n814.9 \\n2,920.1 \\nIndia \\n4,832.6 \\n1,681.5 \\n685.3 \\n1,114.1 \\n5,271.8 \\n1,745.2 \\n846.7 \\n1,266.8 \\n5,722.5 \\n1,849.3 \\n993.5 \\n1,409.6 \\nIndonesia \\n5,546.1 \\n4,758.1 \\n1,233.3 \\n2,142.8 \\n5,625.0 \\n4,756.5 \\n1,167.0 \\n2,010.9 \\n5,833.2 \\n4,859.4 \\n1,171.8 \\n1,961.6 \\nBangladesh \\n7,322.9 \\n4,823.1 \\n1,257.6 \\n2,501.9 \\n7,447.9 \\n4,732.3 \\n1,592.3 \\n2,927.3 \\n7,642.4 \\n4,766.4 \\n1,857.9 \\n3,196.2 \\nVietnam \\n7,388.0  \\n5,208.4  \\n963.2 \\n2,240.9 \\n7,503.2 \\n5,156.1 \\n940.4 \\n2,386.4 \\n7,647.7 \\n5,222.3  \\n960.5 \\n2,513.0 \\nTable 2-3: \\nBaseline production for 2010, 2020 and 2030 for selected countries (metric tonnes) \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\nCountry/ Region \\nIrrigated \\nRainfed \\nDeepwater Upland \\nIrrigated  \\nRainfed  \\nDeepwater \\nUpland \\nIrrigated \\nRainfed Deepwater Upland \\nTop 5 Countries by Production \\nChina \\n185,106,646  \\n136,866  \\n532 \\n72,470  187,171,179  \\n136,879 \\n573 \\n77,697  187,849,985 \\n136,761  \\n607 \\n80,982 \\nIndia \\n128,759,438 18,667,823 \\n701,074 \\n4,544,661 137,564,781 18,975,458 \\n848,345 \\n5,061,283 141,353,559 19,034,013  \\n942,360 \\n5,330,762 \\nIndonesia \\n44,515,927  \\n17,723,001  \\n3,144 \\n3,230,419 45,020,613 17,666,403  \\n2,966 \\n3,022,817  45,509,275 17,593,406  \\n2,903 \\n2,874,405 \\nBangladesh \\n22,123,824 \\n29,082,198 1,870,274 2,471,779 22,891,662 29,029,646 2,409,109 \\n2,942,311 23,309,923 29,015,593  2,789,425 \\n3,187,968 \\nVietnam \\n27,265,526  \\n15,725,436 \\n260,980 \\n1,121,298 27,967,786 15,723,459 \\n257,362 \\n1,206,084  28,142,533 15,722,150  \\n259,495 \\n1,253,843 \\nV-24 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRICE \\nThe global meteorological data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\\u2019s \\nNational Centers for Environmental Prediction climate reanalysis product were used to establish climate \\ndata for 2010 in the model.

(2009). \\nA baseline scenario is established for each country using DNDC 9.5, reflecting assumptions on water \\nmanagement, fertilizer application, residue management and tillage practices described above. Rice \\nyields and GHG fluxes (CH4, direct and indirect N2O and changes in soil organic carbon) were simulated \\nin DNDC model for each grid cell and results were aggregated at the country level for irrigated, rainfed, \\ndeep water, and upland production systems for each scenario, in both mean annual rates per hectare and \\nmean annual national totals. 4 Results were reported for 2010 and by 5-year increments through 2030. \\nFinally, results from DNDC were adjusted with projected acreage of these production systems by the \\nInternational Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)\\u2019s International Model for Policy Analysis of \\nAgricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) model. In DNDC, rice production areas were held \\nconstant at the 2010 level to obtain the biophysical effects of management practice changes on crop yields \\nand GHG fluxes. Projected acreage changes from IMPACT model reflect socio-economic drivers (such as \\npopulation growth) and technological changes to meet the global food demand (Nelson et al., 2010). The \\nIMPACT modeling projects that while global rice production would increase by 11 percent between 2010 \\nand 2030, the total area dedicated to rice cultivation would decrease by 5 percent during the same period \\ndue to productivity improvements. \\n4 The mean values were calculated using weighted averages; rice yields represent total annual yields of rice from all \\nproduction systems. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-31 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nRICE \\nV.2.2.2 \\nEmissions Estimates and Related Assumptions \\nThis section briefly discusses the historical and projected emission trends from global paddy rice \\ncultivation and presents simulated baseline emissions projections. \\nHistorical Emissions Estimates \\nAccording to the EPA Global Emissions Report (GER) (USEPA, 2012), total methane emissions from \\nglobal rice cultivation increased by 4.4% between 1990 and 2005, from 480 MtCO2e to 501 MtCO2e. Asia, \\nthe predominant rice-producing region, accounted for over 80% of the total CH4 emissions in 2005. Africa \\ncontributed another 10%, and the remaining methane emissions in this sector came from Central and \\nSouth America and other regions. The GER did not report historic N2O emissions and soil carbon stock \\nchanges from the rice cultivation sector. \\nProjected Emissions Estimates \\nWorldwide CH4 and N2O emissions from rice cultivation are projected to have only modest increases \\nbetween 2010 and 2030. This is mainly because demand for rice products will remain relatively constant \\nwhile global food demand shifts towards more livestock and other more expensive food products with \\nhigher incomes. The estimated total CH4 emissions from rice cultivation are 484.1 MtCO2e in 2010, 482.2 \\nMtCO2e in 2020 and 472.9 MtCO2e in 2030. The total estimated N2O emissions are 260.0 MtCO2e in 2010, \\n324.5 MtCO2e in 2020 and 340.5 MtCO2e in 2030. \\nV.2.3 \\nAbatement Measures and Engineering Cost Analysis \\nThe mitigation options included in the analysis were based on review of the literature to identify the \\nmost promising options, while also taking data availability and potential for modeling within DNDC into \\nconsideration. For the purposes of developing MAC curves for this study, mitigation options that \\nincrease net emissions of non-CO2 GHG were excluded from the analysis. \\nTwenty-six mitigation scenarios were then analyzed using DNDC 9.5 5. The scenarios addressed \\nmanagement techniques in various combinations hypothesized to reduce GHG emissions from rice \\nsystems: water management regime (continuous flooding, mid-season drainage, dry seeding, alternate \\nwetting and drying, and switching to dryland rice production system), residue management (partial or \\ntotal residue incorporation), tillage, and various fertilizer management alternatives (ammonium sulfate in \\nplace of urea, urea with nitrification inhibitor, slow release urea, 10% reduced fertilizer, 20% reduced \\nfertilizer, and 30% reduced fertilizer). \\nThe water management system under which rice is produced is one of the most important factors \\ninfluencing CH4 emissions. Specifically, switching from continuous flooding of rice paddy fields to \\ndraining flooded fields periodically during the growing season \\u2013 a water conservation practice that is \\nincreasingly adopted in the baseline to reduce water use \\u2013 would significantly reduce CH4 emissions. \\nOther practices (e.g., fertilizer applications, tillage practices and residue management) also alter the soil \\nconditions and hence affect crop yields and the soil carbon- and nitrogen-driving processes such as \\n5 Note that 38 different scenario names are reported in the outputs. Because water management practices are \\nassumed not to affect non-irrigated rice emissions, the simulation results for options combine d with continuous \\nflooding or midseason drainage are the same for non-irrigated rice. The analogous options that alter fertilizer and \\nother management practices but do not affect water management were identified as beginning with \\u201cbase\\u201d rather \\nthan \\u201ccf\\u201d or \\u201cmd\\u201d. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-32 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRICE \\ndecomposition, nitrification and denitrification (Neue and Sass, 1994; Li et al., 2006). Due to the complex \\ninteractions, changes in management practices would trigger changes in multiple GHG fluxes. For \\ninstance, while drainage of rice fields during the growing season would significantly reduce CH4 \\nemissions, emissions of N2O actually increase (Zheng et al., 1997, 2000; Cai et al., 1999; Zou et al. 2007). \\nRice mitigation options \\nThe mitigation options included for rice water management system under which rice is produced is \\none of the most important factors influencing CH4 emissions.

The scenarios addressed \\nmanagement techniques in various combinations hypothesized to reduce GHG emissions from rice \\nsystems:  flood regime (continuous flooding [CF], mid-season drainage [MD], dry seeding [DS], alternate \\nwetting and drying [AWD], and switching to dryland (upland) rice), residue management (partial \\nremoval or 100% incorporation), conventional tillage or no till, and various fertilizer alternatives \\n(conventional / urea, ammonium sulfate in place of urea, urea with nitrification inhibitor, slow release \\nurea, 10% reduced fertilizer, 20% reduced fertilizer, 30% reduced fertilizer, and DNDC optimization of \\nfertilizer application to maximize yields).

For instance, baseline emissions for Bangladesh were determined by averaging the results \\nof the CF and MD scenarios with 50% residue removal (cf_r50 * 0.2 + md_r50 * 0.8). \\nHowever, for the purposes of calculating emissions reductions, mitigation options were compared to \\nthe portions of the baseline to which they could potentially be applied rather than to the national \\nweighted average. For instance, application of the mitigation option of switching to ammonium sulphate \\nfertilizer (cf_r50_amsu) was compared to baseline emissions from continuously flooded rice with \\nconventional fertilizer (cf_r50) and to baseline emissions from rice managed using mid-season drainage \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-35 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nRICE \\nwith conventional fertilizer (md_r50) rather than being compared to the baseline weighted average \\nemissions per ha.

In 2030, total \\nabatement potential in the sector is 21 MtCO2e at no carbon price, 57 MtCO2e at a carbon price of \\n$5/tCO2e, and 124 MtCO2e at a carbon price of $20/tCO2e, representing 2%, 6% and 12% of the net GHG \\nemissions in the year, respectively. Figure 2-4 presents the MAC curves for the global rice cultivation, in \\n2010, 2020 and 2030.

Because many of the mitigation options simulated impact \\nrice yields, the assumption of constant production implies a change in the area devoted to rice \\nproduction. There are options that increase productivity, but also many that decrease productivity. Thus, \\nland requirements may increase or decrease to maintain production at baseline levels, but overall the \\npackage of mitigation options being considered tends to reduce yields. In this sensitivity analysis, we \\nhold the area of cultivated rice at the baseline area and recalculate the MACs. \\nBaseline Acreage \\nThis section explores this relationship further by presenting an alternative scenario built around a \\nconstraint on the number of acres, keeping the harvested area the same as estimated in the baseline. \\nAs before, the MAC model only includes options that result in lower emissions. The result for area \\nheld fixed at projected baseline area is shown in Figure 2-5. Generally speaking, emissions and emission \\nreduction potential are slightly higher although the effects vary by country. Overall, global maximum \\npotential mitigation is 320 MtCO2e, 60% higher than the global maximum potential mitigation of \\n200MtCO2e in the constant production case. Figure 2-6 shows the MAC for the top 5 rice producing \\ncountries under the constant area case. China\\u2019s MAC shows relatively little change under the assumption \\nof constant area, but the other countries show increased emissions mitigation potential to varying \\ndegrees. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-39 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRICE \\nFigure 2-5: \\nMarginal Abatement Cost Curve, Baseline Area Case \\n-$30 \\n-$20 \\n-$10 \\n$0 \\n$10 \\n$20 \\n$30 \\n$40 \\n$50 \\n$60 \\n$/tCO2 e \\n0 \\n50 \\n100 \\n150 \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n200 \\n250 \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\nFigure 2-6: \\nMarginal Abatement Cost Curve for Top 5 Emitters in 2030, Baseline Area Case \\n-$30 \\n-$20 \\n-$10 \\n$0 \\n$10 \\n$20 \\n$30 \\n$40 \\n$50 \\n$60 \\n0.0 \\n5.0 \\n10.0 \\n15.0 \\n20.0 \\n25.0 \\n30.0 \\n35.0 \\n$/tCO2 e \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\nIndia \\nChina \\nIndonesia \\nVietnam \\nBangladesh \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-40 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRICE \\nV.2.5. \\nUncertainties and Limitations \\nGiven the complexities of the global rice sector, the estimated GHG mitigation potential and marginal \\nabatement cost curves are subject to a number of uncertainties and limitations: \\n\\u2022  \\nAvailability and quality of data to represent the highly complex and heterogeneous rice \\nproduction systems of the world. Although there are major improvements in representing the \\nglobal rice production systems and the business-as-usual baseline conditions compared to the \\nprevious EPA report (USEPA, 2006), data in some areas, such as management practices, are not \\nalways available for all countries or regions and approximations must be made based on limited \\nliterature or expert judgment. Moreover, collecting and developing consistent cost estimates of \\nemerging and/or not widely adopted mitigation measures is challenging. \\n\\u2022  \\nBiophysical modeling uncertainties, in particular with respect to soil organic carbon \\nsimulations. The DNDC modeling of the business-as-usual baseline conditions and mitigation \\nscenarios was performed using a set of inputs and assumptions developed based on various \\nsources. The quality of input data ultimately affects the simulated results. Soil organic carbon, \\nwhich has a significant impact on the net GHG emissions from the sector, is particularly \\nchallenging to simulate given the lack of monitoring data at the global scale. Sensitivity tests \\nwould be useful to assess how alternative modeling approaches and assumptions may influence \\nmodeling results. \\n\\u2022  \\nOptimistic assumptions on technology adoption.

The \\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mainly come from two sources, enteric fermentation and \\nmanure management. Methane is produced as a by-product of the digestive process in animals \\nthrough a microbial fermentation process. The quantity of enteric fermentation CH4 emissions is \\ndetermined by the animal\\u2019s digestive system, diet and management practices. Livestock manure \\nmanagement can produce both CH4 and N2O emissions. Methane is produced when manure decomposes \\nunder anaerobic conditions. The quantity of manure CH4 emissions is determined by the type of \\ntreatment or storage facility, the ambient climate, and the composition of the manure. Manure N2O \\nemissions result from nitrification and denitrification of the nitrogen that is excreted in manure and urine. \\nIn 2010, the global non-CO2 GHG emissions from livestock operations were approximately 2,286 \\nMtCO2e. Figure 3-1 presents projected total emissions for the top 5 emitting countries and the total for the \\nrest of the world. \\nMethane emissions predominate with 2,152 MtCO2e emitted in 2010. Globally, livestock is the largest \\nsource of CH4 emissions, contributing approximately 29% of total global CH4 emissions in 2010. As \\nshown in Figure 3-2, the top 5 emitting countries \\u2013 India, China, Brazil, the United States, and Pakistan \\u2013 \\naccounted for 44% of the sector\\u2019s total CH4 emissions.

Methane is produced as a by-product of the digestive process in \\nanimals. This microbial fermentation process produces CH4 that can be exhaled or excreted by the animal. \\nThe quantity of CH4 produced through enteric fermentation depends largely on the animal\\u2019s digestive \\nsystem, diet and management practices. Ruminant animals (e.g., cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels) \\nare the major sources of enteric CH4 emissions; nonruminant animals (e.g., swine, horses, mules) also \\nproduce enteric CH4 emissions but at much lower rates compared to ruminant animals. \\nThe quantity, quality and digestibility of feed significantly affect enteric CH4 emissions. The main \\nconstituents of the diet - sugars, starch, fiber, protein and lipid - appear to have varying impacts on \\nmethane emissions. In general, increased intake of starch and soluble sugars decreases rumen pH, which \\nsuppresses methanogens, thus resulting in lower CH4 emissions. Lower feed quality such as higher \\ncontent of insoluble fiber leads to higher CH4 emissions. Provision of feed supplements, such as dietary \\noils, is found to have an inhibitory effect on CH4 production in the rumen (Hristov et al., 2013). \\nManagement practices that improve animal productivity, such as the usage of antibiotics and bovine \\nsomatotropin (bST), often reduce CH4 emissions per unit of meat or milk even though these activities can \\nincrease CH4 emissions per animal. \\nV.3.2.2 \\nCH4 and N2O Emissions from Manure Management \\nManure Management CH4 Emissions \\nManure management produced about 206 MtCO2e of CH4 in 2010, smaller than enteric fermentation \\nbut still a significant global source of CH4 at about 3% of global total methane production.2 In livestock \\nwaste management systems, CH4 is produced when manure decomposes under anaerobic conditions, for \\nexample in lagoons, ponds or pits. The quantity of CH4 emitted from manure management operations is \\ndetermined by the type of treatment or storage facility, the ambient climate, and the composition of the \\nmanure (USEPA, 2012). Higher ambient temperature and moisture conditions favor CH4 production. \\nManure Management N2O Emissions \\nIn addition to CH4, livestock waste management produced about 135 MtCO2e of N2O in 2010. Nitrous \\noxide is produced from livestock waste through nitrification and denitrification. Nitrous oxide emissions \\nfrom livestock waste depend on the composition of the waste, the type of bacteria involved in the \\ndecomposition process, and the oxygen and liquid content of waste (USEPA 2012). Nitrous oxide \\ngeneration is most likely to occur in dry manure handling systems. \\n2 Global CH4 emissions in 2010 totaled 7,549.2 MTCO2e (USEPA, 2012, Table A2) \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-46 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nLIVESTOCK \\nV.3.2.3 \\nBaseline CH4 and N2O Emissions Estimates \\nThis section discusses the historical and projected baseline emissions for the livestock sector. \\nHistorical emissions are characterized as those released between 1990 and 2005. Projected emissions cover \\nthe 20-year period 2010 \\u2013 2030.3 \\nHistorical Emissions Estimates \\nOver the 1990 \\u2013 2005 period, total non-CO2 GHG emissions from livestock operations increased by 4% \\nbetween 1990 and 2005, from 2,201 to 2,292 MtCO2e (USEPA, 2012). This modest growth is caused by two \\nopposing trends: growth in Africa and Central and South America has been partially offset by the effects \\nof market restructuring in non-OECD Europe. Enteric fermentation CH4 emissions increased 7% between \\n1990 and 2005 while emissions of CH4 and N20 from livestock waste management decreased 9% between \\n1990 and 2005. \\nProjected Emissions Estimates \\nThis analysis uses the 2005 country-level livestock population data from the Global Anthropogenic \\nNon-CO2 Emissions Report (\\u201cGER\\u201d) as a starting point (USEPA, 2012). However, for the period 2010\\u2014 \\n2030 an alternate business-as-usual forecast was constructed using livestock production and market price \\nprojections generated by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)\\u2019s International Model \\nfor Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) (Nelson et al., 2010) to derive \\nprojected livestock populations. A key rationale for relying directly on these model outputs is that the \\nIFPRI IMPACT model projections provide a set of prices and global production patterns consistent with \\ntheir livestock population and productivity assumptions. Using these data improves the internal \\nconsistency of the MAC analysis. 4 \\nTable 3-1 shows projected baseline emissions from livestock management for the top 5 emitting \\ncountries and the rest of the world, divided into major regions. 5 Global emissions from livestock \\nmanagement are projected to grow at an average annual rate of 0.9%. In general, emissions are growing \\nmuch more rapidly in developing countries than in the developed world. \\n3 The year 2010, although historical, is the first year of the modeling forecast period. \\n4 The IMPACT outputs separated the world into 116 regions, with larger countries defined individually and smaller \\ncountries combined into regions. A mapping was created between IMPACT regions and the 195 countries in this \\nanalysis, using shares of country-level livestock population in 2010 based on USEPA (2012) to disaggregate regional \\nprojections from the IMPACT model to individual countries within each region. \\n5 Regional totals exclude the top 5 emitting countries that are presented separately in the table. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-47 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLIVESTOCK \\nTable 3-1: \\nProjected Baseline Emissions from Livestock Management: 2010\\u20132030 (MtCO2e) \\nProjecte\\nd Bas\\neline\\n Emis\\nsions\\n from\\n LIve\\nstock Manage\\nment: 2010 - 2030\\nTable 3-2 summarizes projected baseline emissions from enteric fermentation.

However, developing \\nconsistent and regional-specific cost estimates for emerging mitigation measures or options that are not \\nwidely adopted has proven a challenging task. The measure cost data are scarce and often reflect \\nanecdotal experience reported in a specific country, region or livestock production system. Assumptions \\nhave to be made to extrapolate the estimates in other countries, regions and production systems. This \\nreview uncovered only a few studies where cost information was presented in addition to associated \\nemission reductions for a number of mitigation measures. Moreover, for some mitigation measures, such \\nas those that potentially reduce livestock enteric fermentation CH4 emissions, the literature varies on the \\nestimated magnitude of emissions reductions as well as the long-term mitigation effects and animal and \\nhuman health impacts. \\nBased on the availability and quality of mitigation measure cost and emission reduction efficiency \\ninformation, this analysis evaluates six mitigation options for enteric fermentation CH4 emissions and ten \\noptions for manure management CH4 emissions. Each technology is briefly characterized followed by a \\ndiscussion of abatement measures\\u2019 implementation costs, potential benefits, and system design \\nassumptions used in the MAC analysis. \\nV.3.3.1 \\nEnteric Fermentation CH4 Mitigation Technologies \\nThis section characterizes the mitigation technologies that can be applied to reduce enteric CH4 \\nemissions. Many of the currently available enteric fermentation mitigation options, summarized in Table \\n3-4, work indirectly by increasing animal growth rates and reducing time-to-finish (or increasing milk \\nproduction for dairy cows). The potential GHG mitigation estimated here depends on the assumption \\nthat total production of meat or milk remains the same as in the baseline. Simply put, these strategies \\nwork because increased productivity means fewer animals are required to produce the same amount of \\nmeat or milk, and fewer animals mean reduced GHGs. \\nUnfortunately, many of the productivity enhancing options in this group are not without controversy \\n(Hristov et al., 2013; Grainger et al., 2010). Some, such as bST and antibiotics, have raised concerns \\noutside than their potential role in reducing GHGs. Most have greater than usual uncertainty about costs \\nand effectiveness, especially under long term use. For example, Whittier et al. (2013), in developing MAC \\ncurves for Australia, assume that feed supplements (analogous to Improved Feed Conversion here) and \\nantimethanogen vaccines will become available by 2020 for some types of livestock operations. However, \\nICF international, writing in a report prepared for the USDA, provides only a qualitative description of \\nenteric fermentation GHG mitigation options, excluding them from cost or break-even analysis because \\n\\u201cmore research is needed to evaluate the potential GHG impacts of changes in diets, use of feed \\nadditives, and breeding (ICF International, 2013, p 3.62).\\u201d \\nIn what follows we present descriptions and economic information used to derive the MAC curves. \\nWe examine the sensitivity of these results to productivity assumptions in Section V.3.5 which replaces \\nthe assumption of constant production with an assumption of constant animal population and also \\nexamines a no antimethanogen case. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-50 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLIVESTOCK \\nTable 3-4: \\nAbatement Measures for Enteric Fermentation CH4 \\nFermentati\\non CH4\\nImproved Feed Conversion \\nThis mitigation measure encompasses a number of management practices that would improve the \\nproportion of feed energy converted to final products. The practices include increased amount of grain \\nfed to livestock, and inclusion of dietary additives. This option is more effective in reducing emissions in \\nregions where baseline feed is of relatively low quality. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Cost: Typical annual costs for improving feed are between $2 and $295 per head for beef \\nand dairy cattle. No data were identified for other species. One of the primary costs for this \\noption, as well as most of the others below, is for additional labor costs necessary for \\nimplementation. Differences in labor input share and labor costs per hour are also major reasons \\nfor the wide variation in costs between regions and livestock production systems. \\n\\u2022  \\nAnnual Benefits: Ration improvements result in an increase in yield (kg of meat or milk per \\nanimal) between 0 and 79%. There is considerable variation in the productivity impacts, \\nprimarily related to differences in baseline feed quality and productivity.

Revenues are generated from the use of captured CH4 for either \\nheat or electricity on the farm; these revenues are scaled to other regions based on an electricity price \\nindex. Capital costs and O&M costs for digester systems are mainly based on the USEPA AgSTAR \\nprogram data and experience in the U.S. and the developing countries (USEPA, 2010; Roos, personal \\ncommunication 2012; Costa, personal communication 2012), supplemented by information from USDA \\n(2007, 2011).

major combinations of livestock production systems of the world with respect to \\nland use type and climate. Livestock populations across livestock production systems were assigned for \\npigs, goats, sheep, dairy cattle, and beef cattle based on the country-level data from Robinson et al. (2011). \\nApproximation was made for the distribution of selected species where LPS data were not available. \\nIn addition to disaggregation by LPS, certain livestock species were further disaggregated into \\nproduction intensity categories. For pigs, data were provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization \\n(FAO) that separated country-level pig populations into three intensity categories for each LPS: intensive, \\nsemi-intensive, and extensive. Those data were used to assign intensity levels to pig populations and this \\ndistribution was used as a proxy for poultry production intensity in countries with both pig and poultry \\nproduction. For beef and dairy cattle, regional allocation of cattle across intensity categories in Robinson \\net al. (2011) was used to assign intensity levels to each country located within that region. For other \\nspecies, all intensity levels were defined as unknown. As an example, Table 3-8 presents the assumed \\ndistribution of livestock across livestock production systems and intensity classifications for India, the \\nlargest emitter for the livestock production sector. \\nThe detailed disaggregation of baseline populations allows for better definition of the technical \\napplicability of mitigation options. For instance, this study only applies large-scale digesters to intensive \\ndairy and hog production systems in each country. Intensive grazing is assumed to be applicable only to \\nrelatively high productivity mixed crop-livestock systems that rely on irrigation or are in humid and \\nsubhumid or temperate highland LPS designations. The use of a highly disaggregated baseline in this \\nstudy serves to define the share of emissions where mitigation options can potentially be applied. \\nEnteric fermentation and manure management emissions for each subset of livestock populations \\nwere calculated using the IPCC default values consistent with those used in USEPA (2012). The one \\nexception is for enteric fermentation emissions in Africa, where relative emissions reported in Robinson \\net al. (2011) were used to scale default IPCC emissions per head for different LPS categories. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-61 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n

highlighted at the beginning of this chapter, global abatement potential in the livestock sector \\nequates to approximately 3% of its total annual emissions between 2010 and 2030 at no or a relatively low \\ncarbon price of $5 per ton of CO2 equivalent ($/tCO2e). In 2030, total abatement potential in the livestock \\nsector is 70 MtCO2e at no carbon price, 86 MtCO2e at a carbon price of $5/tCO2e, and 128 MtCO2e at a \\ncarbon price of $20/tCO2e, representing 2.6%, 3.2% and 4.7% of the total sector emissions, respectively. \\nTable 3-9 presents the estimated mitigation potential at various break-even prices for the top-five emitting \\ncountries and rest of regional groups in 2030 under an assumption that livestock populations adjust to \\nmaintain production at baseline levels when mitigation options result in changing productivity. \\nTable 3-9:  \\nAbatement Potential by Region at Selected Break-Even Prices in 2030 (MtCO2e), Baseline \\nProduction Case \\nBreak-Even Price ($/tCO2e) \\nCountry/Region \\n\\u201310 \\n\\u20135 \\n0 \\n5 \\n10 \\n15 \\n20 \\n30 \\n50 \\n100 \\n100+ \\nTop 5 Emitting Countries \\nIndia \\n7.6 \\n7.6 \\n11.7 \\n14.0  \\n14.5 \\n14.5 \\n16.4 \\n22.4 \\n24.7 \\n25.0 \\n27.4 \\nChina \\n5.6 \\n5.6 \\n6.2 \\n6.2  \\n10.4 \\n10.4 \\n14.6 \\n24.1 \\n32.6 \\n35.5 \\n38.3 \\nBrazil \\n4.6 \\n4.6 \\n4.8 \\n6.7  \\n7.1 \\n9.9 \\n10.2 \\n10.6 \\n12.5 \\n13.2 \\n13.6 \\nUnited States \\n0.3 \\n0.3 \\n4.1 \\n8.7  \\n8.7  \\n13.2 \\n13.2 \\n15.5 \\n24.0 \\n37.5 \\n43.2 \\nPakistan \\n0.7 \\n1.7 \\n2.5 \\n2.5  \\n2.5 \\n2.7 \\n2.7 \\n3.1 \\n3.1 \\n4.4 \\n5.6 \\nRest of Region \\nAfrica \\n8.7 \\n9.3 \\n11.8 \\n12.3  \\n12.6 \\n12.9 \\n13.1 \\n13.3 \\n13.6 \\n14.0 \\n14.6 \\nAsia \\n12.3 \\n13.6 \\n18.1 \\n21.2 \\n24.8  \\n26.3  \\n30.2  \\n35.0 \\n38.1 \\n40.4  \\n45.5 \\nCentral & South \\nAmerica \\n5.8 \\n6.4 \\n7.8 \\n8.9 \\n10.4 \\n11.1 \\n12.6 \\n13.1 \\n14.2 \\n14.8 \\n15.2 \\nEurasia \\n1.2 \\n1.3 \\n1.4 \\n1.5  \\n1.6 \\n1.6 \\n1.6 \\n1.6 \\n1.8 \\n2.0 \\n2.7 \\nEurope \\n6.2 \\n6.4 \\n10.7 \\n11.0 \\n11.3 \\n12.4 \\n15.5 \\n16.4 \\n20.9 \\n29.7 \\n50.6 \\nMiddle East \\n1.5 \\n1.5 \\n1.6 \\n1.6 \\n1.6 \\n1.6  \\n1.7 \\n1.7 \\n1.7 \\n1.7 \\n1.9 \\nNorth America \\n1.3 \\n1.7 \\n2.5 \\n2.5  \\n2.6  \\n3.8  \\n4.4  \\n5.0 \\n6.2 \\n9.2  \\n10.0 \\nWorld Total \\n55.7 \\n60.0 \\n83.3 \\n97.2 \\n108.1 \\n120.5 \\n136.3 \\n161.6 \\n193.3 \\n227.5 \\n268.6 \\nMitigation potential and its cost-effectiveness vary significantly by country or region.

Although many of the mitigation options examined are expected to increase \\nproductivity and would therefore require fewer animals to produce the same amount of output, livestock \\npopulations may not decrease accordingly. Due to increasing demand for livestock products and \\npotential reductions in the price of these products with higher productivity, the quantity of livestock \\nproducts demanded may increase. Thus, we examine an alternative scenario that holds the number of \\nlivestock constant at the projected baseline populations. To the extent that productivity is increased by \\nadoption of the GHG mitigation options considered, this scenario will result in higher global production. \\nIn addition, given mixed conclusions on the near-term prospects of antimethanogens, we also present \\nmitigation estimates developed excluding antimethanogens as an option. \\nBaseline Number of Animals \\nAs noted above, many of the mitigation options in the baseline production case reduce the emissions \\nper unit of meat or milk but may increase the emissions per animal. This section explores this relationship \\nfurther by presenting an alternative scenario built around a constraint on the number of animals, keeping \\nthe herd sizes the same as estimated in the baseline. \\nAs before, the MAC model only includes options that result in lower emissions. But with the number \\nof animals held constant, those mitigation strategies that increase emissions per animal in a given region \\nare excluded in that region. The result is 15 to 39% lower mitigation potential as shown in Figure 3-7 and \\nTable 3-10. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-65 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLIVESTOCK \\nFigure 3-7: \\nGlobal Abatement Potential in Livestock Management, Baseline Number of Animals : 2010,\\n2020, and 2030 \\n-$30 \\n-$20 \\n-$10 \\n$0 \\n$10 \\n$20 \\n$30 \\n$40 \\n$50 \\n$60 \\n$/tCO2e \\n0 \\n50 \\n100 \\n150 \\n200 \\n250 \\nNon-CO2 Reduction (MtCO2e) \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\nTable 3-10: \\nMAC Results and Differences from Constant Production Case for Baseline Number of Animals \\nScenario \\n2010 \\n2020 \\n2030 \\nTotal \\nDifference from \\nTotal \\nDifference from \\nTotal \\nDifference \\nReduction \\nConstant \\nReduction \\nConstant \\nReduction \\nfrom Constant \\n$/tCO2e \\nMTCO2e \\nProduction (%) \\nMTCO2e \\nProduction(%) \\nMTCO2e \\nProduction (%) \\n0 \\n49 \\n-21%  \\n54 \\n-19% \\n60 \\n-15% \\n5 \\n58 \\n-20% \\n61 \\n-22% \\n65 \\n-25% \\n10 \\n65  \\n-27% \\n68 \\n-27% \\n73 \\n-25% \\n15 \\n79 \\n-25% \\n78 \\n-29% \\n81 \\n-26% \\n20 \\n84  \\n-29% \\n88 \\n-31% \\n87 \\n-31% \\n25 \\n86 \\n-33% \\n91 \\n-33% \\n97 \\n-33% \\n30 \\n90  \\n-35% \\n97 \\n-34% \\n101 \\n-35% \\n35 \\n93 \\n-37% \\n98 \\n-34% \\n106 \\n-33% \\n40 \\n96 \\n-39% \\n101  \\n-39% \\n109 \\n-35% \\n45 \\n98 \\n-39% \\n103  \\n-39% \\n113 \\n-37% \\n50 \\n102  \\n-39% \\n108  \\n-39% \\n118 \\n-38% \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-66 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLIVESTOCK \\nNo Antimethanogen \\nThe science and policy literature varies in its treatment of antimethanogens.

Although there are major improvements in the characterization \\nof the business-as-usual baseline conditions since the previous EPA report (USEPA, 2006), data in \\nsome areas, such as management practices, are not always available for all countries or regions \\nand approximations must be made based on limited literature or expert judgment. \\n\\u2022  \\nAvailability of mitigation measure cost data and in some cases scientific understanding of \\nmitigation impacts. Collecting and developing consistent cost estimates of emerging mitigation \\nmeasures or options that are not widely adopted has proven to be challenging. Moreover, \\nscientific understanding of the mitigation effects and animal and human health impacts of some \\nmitigation measures is still limited. In addition, some mitigation measures, such as pasture \\nmanagement options that lead to reductions in enteric CH4 emissions and enhancement in soil \\ncarbon storage, would require a different analytical framework that is beyond the scope of this \\nstudy. \\nGLOBAL MITIGATION OF NON-CO2 GREENHOUSE GASES \\nV-71 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nLIVESTOCK \\n\\u2022  \\nOptimistic assumptions on technology adoption.

Usually one colour dominates and \\nthe other use supports and balances the composition. \\n\\u2022\\t\\nTraffic light system\\nIn general this coding should be avoided as the combination of red and green \\nis the most problematic one for colour-blind users.
